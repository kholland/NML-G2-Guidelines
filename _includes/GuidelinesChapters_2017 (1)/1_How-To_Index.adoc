How-To Index

The Implementation Guide is written using worked examples and use cases in order to give implementers an insight into the practical application of NewsML-G2 features. It may be helpful to have the NewsML-G2 Specification at hand; this will contain further detailed information about features discussed. This document can be downloaded by visiting http://www.newsml-g2.org/spec[www.newsml-g2.org/spec].

Implementers picking up these full Guidelines after reading the separately available “Quick Start” guides may wish to go straight to the How To topics for answers to specific questions.
