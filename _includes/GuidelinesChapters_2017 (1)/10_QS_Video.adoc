Quick Start: Video
------------------

[[introduction-5]]
Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that streamed media is part of everyone’s day-to-day experience on
the Web, organisations with little or no tradition of "broadcast media"
production need to be able to process audio and video.

NewsML-G2 allows all media organisations, whether traditional
broadcasters or not, to access and exchange audio and video in a
professional workflow, by providing features and Extension Points that
enable proprietary formats to be "mapped" to Newsml-G2 to achieve
freedom of exchange amongst a wider circle of information partners.

This Quick Start guide is split into two parts:

* Part I deals with a video that is available in multiple different
renditions and the example focuses on expressing the technical
characteristics of each rendition of the content.
* Part II shows an example of video content has been assembled from
multiple sources, each with distinct metadata.

We recommend reading the Quick Start Guide to NewsML-G2 Basics +
before this Quick Start Guide.

The following example is based on a sample NewsML-G2 video item from
Agence France Presse (but is not a guide to processing AFP’s NewsML-G2
news services).

Document structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The building blocks of the NewsML-G2 Item are the <newsItem> root
element, with additional wrapping elements for metadata about the News
Item (itemMeta), metadata about the content (contentMeta) and the
content itself (contentSet).

The root <newsItem> attributes are:

<newsItem xmlns="http://iptc.org/std/nar/2006-10-01/"

[[item-metadata-itemmeta-3]]
Item Metadata <itemMeta>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The <itemClass> property uses a QCode from the IPTC News Item Nature
NewsCodes to denote that the Item conveys a picture. Note that
<provider> uses the recommended IPTC Provider NewsCodes, a controlled
vocabulary of providers registered with the IPTC, recommended scheme
alias "nprov":

[[video-content]]
Video Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Video is conveyed within the NewsML-G2 <contentSet> using the
<remoteContent> element; where there are multiple alternate renditions
of SAME content, <remoteContent> can be repeated for each rendition
within the same Item.

The <remoteContent> element references binary objects that exist
independently of the current NewsML-G2 document. In this example there
is an instance of <remote Content> for each of three renditions of the
video.

Each remote content instance contains attributes that can conceptually
be split into three groups:

* *Target resource attributes* enable the receiver to accurately
identify the remote resource, its content type and size;
* *Content attributes* enable the processor to distinguish the different
business purposes of the content using @rendition;
* *Content Characteristics* contain technical metadata such as
dimensions, duration and format.

Frequently used attributes from these groups are described below, but
note that the NewsML-G2 XML structure that delimits the groups may not
be visible in all XML editors. For a detailed description of these
attribute groups, see the NewsML-G2 Specification (This can be
downloaded by visiting
http://www.newsml-g2.org/spec[www.newsml-g2.org/spec] and following the
link to NewsML-G2.)

[[target-resource-attributes-1]]
Target Resource Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This group of attributes express administrative metadata, such as
identification and versioning, for the referenced content, which could
be a file on a mounted file system, a Web resource, or an object within
a content management system. NewsML-G2 flexibly supports alternative
methods of identifying and locating the externally-stored content.

The two attributes of <remoteContent> that identify and optionally
locate the content are Hyperlink (@href) and Resource Identifier
Reference (@residref). Either one MUST be used to identify the target
resource. They MAY optionally be used together.

Although @href and @resideref are superficially similar, their intended
use is:

* @href _locates_ any resource, using an IRI.
* @residref _identifies_ a _managed_ resource, using an identifier that
may be globally unique. It is up to the provider to specify how
@residref may be resolved to retrieve the actual content.

[[hyperlink-href-1]]
Hyperlink (@href)
+++++++++++++++++

An IRI, for example:

<remoteContent

href="http://components.afp.com/ab652af034e5f7acc131f8f122b274a5ef8ee37e.mpg"

[[resource-identifier-reference-residref-1]]
Resource Identifier Reference (@residref)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An XML Schema string e.g.

<remoteContent residref="tag:example.com,2008:PIX:FOO20081220098658"

[[version-2]]
Version
++++++++

An XML Schema positive integer denoting the version of the target
resource. In the absence of this attribute, recipients should assume
that the target is the latest available version

version="8"

[[content-type-1]]
Content Type
++++++++++++

The Media Type of the target resource

contenttype=" video/3gpp"

[[format]]
Format
++++++

A refinement of a Content Type using a value from a controlled
vocabulary:

format="fmt:video"

[[content-type-variant-contenttypevariant]]
Content Type Variant (@contenttypevariant)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A refinement of a Content Type using a string:

contenttype="video/3gpp"

contenttypevariant="MPEG-4 Simple Profile"

[[size-1]]
Size
++++

Indicates the size of the target resource in bytes.

size="54593540"

[[news-content-attributes-1]]
News Content Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This group of attributes of <remoteContent> enables a processor or human
operator to distinguish between different components; in this case the
alternative resolutions of the video.

[[rendition-1]]
Rendition
+++++++++

The rendition attribute MUST use a QCode. Providers may have their own
schemes, or use the IPTC NewsCodes for rendition, which has a Scheme URI
of http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/rendition/ and recommended Scheme Alias
of "rnd". This example uses a provider-specific scheme with a Scheme
Alias of "vidrnd":

<remoteContent rendition="vidrnd:dvd"

To avoid processing ambiguity, each specific rendition value should be
used only once per News Item, except when the same rendition is
available from multiple remote locations. In this case, the same value
of rendition may be given to several Remote Content elements.

[[news-content-characteristics-1]]
News Content Characteristics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This third a group of attributes of <remoteContent> is provided to
enable further efficiencies in processing and describes physical
characteristics of the referenced object specific its media type. Text,
for example, may use @wordcount; Audio and video are provided with
attributes appropriate to streamed media, such as @audiobitrate,
@videoframerate. The appropriate attributes for video are described
below.

[[duration-duration-and-durationunit]]
Duration (@duration and @durationunit)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Indicates the duration of the content in seconds by default, but can be
expressed by some other measure of temporal reference (e.g. frames) when
using the optional @durationunit. From NewsML-G2 2.14, the data-type of
@duration is a string; earlier versions use non-negative integer. The
reason for the change is that video duration is often expressed using
non-integer values.

For example, expressing duration as an SMPTE time code requires the
following NewsML-G2:

duration="00:06:32:12" durationunit="timeunit:timeCode"

The recommended CV for @durationunit is the IPTC Time Unit NewsCodes
whose URI is http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/timeunit/. The recommended
alias for the scheme is "timeunit".

[[video-codec-videocodec]]
Video Codec (@videocodec)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

A QCode value indicating the encoding of the video – for example one of
the encodings used in this example is MPEG-2 Video Simple Profile. This
is indicated by the IPTC Video Codec NewsCodes with a recommended Scheme
Alias "vcdc", and the corresponding code is "c015".

videocodec="vcdc:c015"

[[video-frame-rate-videoframerate]]
Video Frame Rate (@videoframerate)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A decimal value indicating the rate, in frames per second [fps] at which
the video should be played out to achieve the correct visual effect.
Common values (in fps) are 25, 50, 60 and 29.97 (drop-frame rate):

videoframerate="25"

[[video-aspect-ratio-videoaspectratio]]
Video Aspect Ratio (@videoaspectratio)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A string value, e.g. 4:3, 16:9

videoaspectratio="4:3"

[[video-scaling-videoscaling]]
Video Scaling (@videoscaling)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The @videoscaling attribute describes how the aspect ratio of a video
has been changed from the original in order to accommodate a different
display dimension:

videoscaling="sov:letterboxed"

The value of the property is a QCode; the recommended CV is the IPTC
Video Scaling NewsCodes (Scheme URI:
http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/videoscaling/)

The recommended Scheme Alias is "sov", and the codes and their
definitions are as follows:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|*Code * |*Definition*
|unscaled  |no scaling applied

|mixed |two or more different aspect ratios are used in the video over
the timeline

|pillarboxed |bars to the left and right

|letterboxed |bars to the top and bottom

|windowboxed |pillar boxed plus letter boxed

|zoomed |scaling to avoid any borders
|=======================================================================

[[video-definition-videodefinition]]
Video Definition (@videodefinition)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Editors may need to know whether video content is HD or SD, as this may
not be obvious from the technical specification ("HD", for example, is
an umbrella term covering many different sets of technical
characteristics). The @videodefinition attribute carries this
information:

videodefinition="videodef:sd"

The value of the property can be either "hd" or "sd", as defined by the
Video Definition NewsCodes CV. The Scheme URI is
http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/videodefinition/ and the recommended scheme
alias is "videodef".

[[colour-indicator-colourindicator]]
Colour Indicator <colourindicator>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Indicates whether the still or moving image is coloured or black and
white (note the UK spelling of colour). The recommended vocabulary is
the IPTC Colour Indicator NewsCodes (Scheme URI:
http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/colourindicator/) with a recommended Scheme
Alias of "colin". The value of the property is "bw" or "colour":

colourindicator="colin:colour"

The completed Remote Content wrapper will be:

<remoteContent contenttype="video/mpeg-2"

href="http://components.afp.com/ab652af034e5f7acc131f8f122b274a5ef8ee37e.mpg"

rendition="vidrnd:dvd"

size="54593540"

width="720" height="576"

duration__="69"

durationunit__="timeunit:seconds"

videocodec="vcdc:c015"

videoframerate="25" __

videodefinition="videodef:sd"

colourindicator="colin:colour"

videoaspectratio="4:3"

videoscaling="sov:letterboxed" />

[[audio-metadata]]
Audio metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are specific properties for describing the technical
characteristics of audio, for example:

[[audio-bit-rate-audiobitrate]]
Audio Bit Rate (@audiobitrate)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A positive integer indicating kilobits per second (Kbps)

audiobitrate__="32"

[[audio-sample-rate-audiosamplerate]]
Audio Sample Rate (@audiosamplerate)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A positive integer indicating the sample rate in Hertz (Hz)

audiosamplerate__="44100"

For a detailed description of all of the News Content Characteristics
for Video and Audio content, see section _News Content Characteristics_
in the NewsML-G2 Specification Document

[[part-2-multi-part-video]]
Part 2 – Multi-part video
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend reading the Quick Start Guide to NewsML-G2 Basics and the
preceding Part 1 of +
this guide to video before reading Part 2.

[[introduction-6]]
Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Audio and video, including animation, have a temporal dimension: the
nature of the content is expected to change over its duration: in this
example a single piece of video has been created from a number of shots
– shorter segments of content – from several different creators that
were combined during an editing process.footnote:[Note that this
complies with the basic NewsML-G2 rule that "one piece of content = one
newsItem". Although the video may be composed of material from many
sources, it remains a single piece of journalistic content created by
the video editor. This is analogous to a text story that is compiled by
a single reporter or editor from several different reports.] Each
segment of streamed content has its own metadata, in addition to the
metadata that applies to the content as a whole.

In addition to metadata structures that apply to the whole content,
NewsML-G2 can express metadata about separate identifiable parts of
content using <partMeta>.

The example video is about a retrospective exhibition in Berlin of works
by the German humourist and animator Vicco von Bülow. It consists of a
number of shots, so provides a shotlist summarising the visual content
of each shot, and a dopesheet, giving an editorial summary of the
video’s content.

The document structure and the NewsML-G2 properties included in the
example have been previously described, except for the <partMeta>
wrapper, which is described in detail below. A full code listing for the
example is included at the end.

The example is based on a sample NewsML-G2 video item from the European
Broadcasting Union (EBU). The News Item references a multi-part
broadcast video and contains separate metadata for each segment of the
content, including a keyframe, and additionally describes the technical
characteristics of the video.

Please note that it may resemble but does NOT represent the EBU’s
NewsML-G2 implementation.

<description role="descrole:dopesheet">

Yesterday evening (November, 5) an exhibition opened in Berlin in

honour of German humorist Vicco von Bülow, better known under the

pseudonym "Loriot", to commemorate his 85th birthday. He was born

November 12, 1923 in Brandenburg an der Havel and comes from an old

German aristocratic family. He is most well-known for his cartoons,

television sketches alongside late German actress Evelyn Hammann.

[[part-metadata]]
Part Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

G2 Items can have many <partMeta> wrappers, each expressing properties
for an identifiably separate part of the content; in this example each
of the shots, or segments, which make up the video. The properties for
each segment include:

* an ID for the segment, and a sequence number
* a keyframe, or icon that may help to visually identify the content of
the segment
* the start time and duration of the segment

It is also possible to assert any Administrative or Descriptive Metadata
for each <partMeta> element, if required.

The id and sequence number for the shot are expressed as attributes of
<partMeta> and the <partMeta> element is repeated for each video
segment. Below is a complete example of a single segment:

<partMeta partid="Part1_ID" seq="1">

<icon href=" http://www.example.com/video/Keyframes/407624.jpeg"/>

<timeDelim start="0" end="446"
timeunit="timeunit:editUnit"/>

<language tag="en" role="lrol:voiceOver" />

<description>Vicco von Bülow entering exhibition</description>

</partMeta>

These elements of video <partMeta> are discussed below.

[[add-keyframe-using-icon]]
Add keyframe using <icon>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

A keyframe for the video segment is expressed as the child element
<icon> with @href pointing to the keyframe image as a resource on the
Web:

<icon href="http://www.example.com/video/Keyframes/407624.jpeg"/>

[[timing-metadata]]
Timing metadata
+++++++++++++++

The <timeDelim> property indicates the start and end time of this
segment, and the time unit being used as shown below:

<timeDelim start="0" end="446"
timeunit="timeunit:editUnit"/>

In the example, @start and @end are expressed as integers but note that
the datatype of @start and @end is XML String, because start and end
times can be expressed as integer, time, or SMPTE time code.

@timeunit use a QCode to indicate that @start and @end are expressed as
frames, the smallest editable unit of video content. This is the default
and is assumed if @timeunit is not present in the <timeDelim> element.
Other values of time unit MUST be taken from the IPTC Time Unit
NewsCodes (recommended Scheme Alias "timeunit").

The values in the scheme are:

* editUnit: (default) the time is expressed in frames (video) or samples
(audio).
* timeCode: the format of the timestamp is hh:mm:ss:ff (ff for frames).
* timeCodeDropFrame: the format of the timestamp is hh:mm:ss:ff (ff for
frames).
* normalPlayTime: the format of the timestamp is hh:mm:ss.sss
(milliseconds).
* seconds.
* milliseconds.

When specifying the start and end points of a video segment, be aware
that these are unlikely to be frame-accurate for the same shot rendered
in different technical formats, due to potentially differing
frame-rates. They may even produce different viewing results.

To overcome this issue, the attribute @renditionref has been added to
<timeDelim>, allowing implementers to specify separate time delimiters
corresponding to alternative renditions of the same shot.

Please note: @renditionref is not used in the main code example.

<partMeta....>

<!-- 10 seconds in frames at 25 fps = 250 frames -->

<timeDelim renditionref="_vidrnd:avi25"_ start="0" end="250" +
__timeunit="timeunit:editUnit"/>

<!-- 10 seconds in frames at 30 fps = 300 frames -->

<timeDelim renditionref="vidrnd:avi30" start="0" end="300" +
timeunit="timeunit:editUnit"/>

</partMeta>

Each @renditionref identifies a corresponding @rendition in
<remoteContent>:

<contentSet>

<remoteContent contenttype="..."

href="..."

rendition="vidrnd:avi25"

... />

<remoteContent contenttype="..."

href="..."

rendition="vidrnd:avi30"

_..._/>

</contentSet>

[[description-and-language]]
Description and Language
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The example also indicates the language being used in the shot, and the
context in which it is used. In this case, @role uses a QCode from a
proprietary EBU scheme to indicate that the soundtrack of the shot is a
voiceover in English.

<language tag="en" role="langusecode:VoiceOver" />

Implementers may also use the IPTC Language Role NewsCodes (recommended
Scheme Alias "lrol") for this purpose.

Using <description>, we can also indicate what the viewer can expect to
see in this segment:

[[video-content-1]]
Video Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The <contentSet wrapper contains a single rendition of the video inside
the <remoteContent> element:

<contentSet>

<remoteContent href="http://www.example.com/video/407624.avi"

format="fmt:avi" __

duration="111" durationunit="timeunit:seconds"

videocodec="vcdc:c155"

videoframerate="25"

videoaspectratio="16:9" />

</contentSet>
