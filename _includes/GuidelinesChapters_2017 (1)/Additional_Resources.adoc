The IPTC welcomes new members. Membership is the backbone of the IPTC,
and levels vary for both organizations and individuals. Additionally,
several "working parties" and "working groups" focus on specific topic
areas and standards. IPTC also hosts three face-to-face meetings a year
around the globe, where its working parties discuss and develop their
ideas to support information exchange and the rapid innovation of media.
