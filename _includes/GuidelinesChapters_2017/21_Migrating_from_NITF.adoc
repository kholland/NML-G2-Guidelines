Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: This Guide refers to NITF v 3.5. A new version 3.6 was released in January 2012. Please visit
https://iptc.org/standards/[www.iptc.org/standards] and follow the link
to NITF for further details of NITF and to download a package of the new
version and its documentation

NITF is an XML-based standard for marking up text articles that includes
the ability both to create a structure for the content, and to provide a
clear separation of content and metadata.

NITF differs from NewsML-G2:

* NITF provides a mark-up structure for text; NewsML-G2 is a container
for news, is content-agnostic and has no mark-up for text content.
* NITF expresses a single piece of content and does not support, for
example, alternative renditions or different parts of the same content.
* NITF properties have tightly-defined meanings; NewsML-G2 makes more
use of generic structures that can be adapted for different uses.
Therefore there may not be a direct equivalent in NewsML-G2 for a given
NITF property, but a generic structure may be used to express the
provider’s intention equally effectively.

The following table summarises the major differences between the two
standards.

|============================

NITF is a popular and valid choice for the management and mark-up of
text in a news environment. This Chapter assumes that organisations wish
to continue to use NITF for the mark-up of text, but to migrate to
NewsML-G2 as a management container. There are three basic migration
paths:

* Minimum migration: retain NITF and all of its structures in place, and
use a minimal NewsML-G2 News Item as a container for NITF documents.
NewsML-G2 would convey the complete original NITF document.
* Partial migration: copy or move some of NITF’s metadata structures to
the equivalent NewsML-G2 properties, retaining some or all NITF metadata
structures and structural mark-up of the text content.
* Complete migration: move the NITF metadata to the NewsML-G2
equivalents, using NewsML-G2 to convey a text document with NITF content
mark-up.

For a minimum migration, implementers need only to refer to the Quick
Start Guides to xref::quick-start-newsml-g2-basics[NewsML-G2 Basics] and
xref::quick-start-text[Text].

For partial or complete migration, the starting point is a consideration
of how the structure of NITF relates to NewsML-G2, to form a high-level
view of which NITF properties are to be migrated, and where they fit in
NewsML-G2 framework.

[[overview-of-nitf-and-newsml-g2-equivalents]]
Overview of NITF and NewsML-G2 equivalents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NITF documents are composed of the following components:

* The root element: <nitf>
* <head>, a container for metadata about the document as a whole
* <body> a container for content and metadata which is intended for
display to the user. The <body> component is further split into:
* <body-head> Metadata about the content
* <body-content> The content itself
* <body-end>Information that is intended to appear at the end of the
article.

[[root-element-nitf]]
Root element <nitf>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The root element may uniquely identify the document using @uno, which is
equivalent to NewsML-G2 @guid.

[[document-metadata-head]]
Document metadata <head>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

<head> may have a @id attribute, a local identifier for the element.
Most of the child elements of <head> have equivalents in the NewsML-G2
<itemMeta> component, with exceptions noted in the following table:

[%autowidth,options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|NITF element |NewsML-G2 equivalent |Comment
|<title> |<title> |The properties are equivalent in NITF and NewsML-G2

|<meta> |<itemClass> |<itemClass> uses the IPTC News Item Nature
NewsCodes to identify the type of content.

|<tobject> |<subject> |This is part of NewsML-G2 <contentMeta>

|<iim> |None |Deprecated in NITF, no NewsML-G2 equivalent

|<docdata> |Various |A container for detailed metadata for the document.
contains child elements as tabled in 21.2.2.1 below

|<pubdata> |None |NewsML-G2 contains no direct equivalent of Publication
Metadata. In NITF, the property has many attributes intended to convey
information about print publications

|<revision-history> | |Attributes can express the date and reason for
the revision, the name and job title of the person who made the revision
|=======================================================================

[[docdata-child-elements]]
<docdata> child elements
++++++++++++++++++++++++

These convey detailed management information about the document.

[%autowidth,options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|NITF element |NewsML-G2 equivalent |Comment
|<correction> |<signal> |Indicates that the item is a correction,
identifies the previously published document and any correction
instruction. NewsML-G2 <signal> contains a QCode so that processing
instructions are constrained by a controlled vocabulary. The property
may have a <name> child element and be accompanied by <edNote> conveying
a human-readable message about the instruction.

|<ev-loc> |<subject> |<ev-loc> contains information about where the news
event took place. The NewsML-G2 equivalent of <subject> may use a @role
to indicate that the subject is a geographic place. If used, the IPTC
Concept Type NewsCodes would be either "geoArea" or "poi" (Point of
Interest)

|<doc-id> |G2 Item @guid |Unique persistent identifier for the document

|<del-list> |<timestamp> |Audit trail of points involved in delivery of
the document. May be expressed in the <timestamp> property of a
NewsML-G2 News Message <header>.

|< urgency> |< urgency> |Editorial urgency of the document. NITF uses
values 1-8, NewsML-G2 uses 1-9. The value may also be linked to Priority
<priority> in a NewsML-G2 News Message.

|< fixture> |< instanceOf> |Regularly occurring and/or frequently
updated content, for example "Noon Weather Report" or "Closing Stock
Market Prices". In NewsML-G2, this is a Flex1PropType property type (PCL
only), a template that allows the use of a controlled or uncontrolled
value.

|< date.issue> |Various |The default NewsML-G2 property would be
<versionCreated>, but depending on the provider’s intention,
<firstCreated>, <contentCreated> or <contentModified> could be used.

|< date.release> |Various a|
NewsML-G2 does not have a direct equivalent for this property. In NITF,
the default value is the time of receipt of the document. Where a
provider wishes to specifically delay a release, the NewsML-G2
<embargoed> property may be used.

If the provider wishes to express a timestamp of the time that the
document was released, a timestamp property such as <sent> in News
Message should be used.

|<date.expire> |@validto |At PCL, the <remoteContent> wrapper may have a
Time Validity Attribute of @validto.

|<doc-scope> |<audience> a|
Area of interest that is not a Category, for example geographic: "of
interest to people living in Toronto". This is not the same intention as
a <subject> of Toronto, which means "about" or "linked to" Toronto.

If content should be seen by "Equity Traders" but is not of the Subject
"Equities", then the NewsML-G2 <audience> property may be used.

|<series> |<memberOf> a|
In NITF, this is intended to indicate that the article is one of a
series of articles, its place in the order of the series, out of a total
number of articles in the series.

The NewsML-G2 equivalent <memberOf> is a Flex1PropType (PCL only) which
may take a controlled or uncontrolled value.

|<ed-msg> |<edNote> |As with NITF, the type of message may be indicated
by @role in NewsML-G2

|< du-key> |None |NITF uses this property for maintaining a network of
relationships to other versions of the same article. NewsML-G2 uses
GUID, versioning and, if necessary, Links, to maintain this information

|<doc.copyright> |< rightsInfo> |In NewsML-G2, the <rightsInfo>
container may hold information about the copyright holder, copyright
statement, the entity legally accountable for the content, and usage
terms.

|<doc.rights> |<rightsInfo> |

|<key-list> |<keyword> |Each keyword is conveyed in a separate NewsML-G2
<keyword> element.

|< identified-content> |< inlineRef> a|
This container is used in NITF to hold information about entities such
as people, organisations, places or events with an @id enabling it to be
referenced from within the content mark-up.

The NewsML-G2 equivalent <inlineRef> enables a Concept to be referenced
by @idrefs, and contains a QCode identifying the Concept in a controlled
vocabulary. Locally, any mark-up element (for example <span> in XHTML
capable of using @id may be linked via <inlineRef> to the concept.

|=======================================================================

[[content-metadata-body.head]]
Content metadata <body.head>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The contents of <body.head> a broadly equivalent to those of
<contentMeta>, although this is not universally true. The following
table lists the child elements of <body.head> and their NewsML-G2
equivalents.

When conveying NITF in a NewsML-G2 document, some properties of
<body.head> may be retained in the NITF document, since they may be part
of the structural content of the article, such as <hedline> (note
spelling) and <byline>. These properties may optionally be copied into
their NewsML-G2 equivalents.

[%autowidth,options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|NITF element |NewsML-G2 equivalent |Comment
|<hedline> |<headline> |NewsML-G2 <headline> is contained in
<contentMeta> and may appear any number of times. It can be refined by
using @role to express the NITF notions of main headline <hl1> and
subhead <hl2>

|<note> |Various a|
An advisory for editors may be equivalent to NewsML-G2 <edNote>in
<itemMeta>, but NITF <note> has a number of uses, including expressing
copyright, and may also be publishable.

Provider’s migrating from NITF to NewsML-G2 will need to identify the
intention of their use of <note> and choose from several NewsML-G2
properties that express this intention, for example <rightsInfo> (a
property of an Item root element), or <description> (part of
<contentMeta>) with a @role defining its purpose.

Customers converting an NITF service to NewsML-G2 will need to consult
with their provider, either directly or via documentation.

|<rights> |< rightsInfo> |See xref::docdata-child-elements[<docdata] above

|<byline> |<by> |If using every available feature of NITF <byline>,
NewsML-G2 <by> should be implemented at PCL. It is part of <contentMeta>

|<distributor> |<provider> |<provider> is a mandatory property of
NewsML-G2 <itemMeta>

|<dateline> |< dateline> |NewsML-G2 <dateline> is part of <contentMeta>

|< abstract> |< description> |NewsML-G2 <description> is part of
<contentMeta> and may be refined by @role. The IPTC Description Role
NewsCodes value would be "summary"

|<series> |<memberOf> |See xref::docdata-child-elements[<docdata] above
|=======================================================================

[[body-content-body.-content]]
Body Content <body. content>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NewsML-G2 has no specific mark-up for text, and NITF is a valid choice
for marking up text to be conveyed by NewsML-G2 <inlineXML>.
  
[[_Ref222628059]]

.LISTING: An NITF marked-up article conveyed in <inlineXML>

[source, xml]
----
include::{includedir}/../../GuidelinesCodeExamples_2017/LISTING_25_An_NITF_marked-up_article_conveyed_in_inlineXML.xml[]
----

[[end-of-body-body.end]]
End of Body <body.end>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no formal equivalent to the <body.end> container in NewsML-G2.
It’s placement at the end of <body.content> expresses its significance
in the format of an article. So it is possible that they would need to
be retained in the NITF content conveyed in <inlineXML>, or expressed in
another mark-up language.

The NewsML-G2 equivalent of <tagline> would be <by> with a @role if
necessary to refine its use. <bibliography> may be expressed using
NewsML-G2 <description> with a @role. Their placement relative to the
parent text is a processing issue – NewsML-G2 is format-agnostic.
