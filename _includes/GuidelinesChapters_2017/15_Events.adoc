Events in NewsML-G2

[[a-standard-for-exchanging-news-event-information]]
A standard for exchanging news event information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sharing of event-related information and planning of news coverage
is a core activity of news organisations, without which they cannot
function effectively.

News agencies need to keep their customers _informed_ of upcoming events
and planned coverage. News organisations publishing on paper and digital
media need to _plan and co-ordinate_ their operations in order to make
optimum use of their available resources and ensure their target
audiences will be properly served.

Historically, this was a paper-based exercise, with news desks
maintaining a Day Book, or Diary, and circulating information to
colleagues and partners using written memoranda, sometimes referred to
as the Schedule, or Budget.

Many organisations have moved, or are moving, to electronic scheduling
applications. With software developers and vendors working independently
on these applications, there is a risk that incompatibility will inhibit
the exchange of information and reduce efficiency.

Consequently, there has been a drive among IPTC members to formalise a
standard for exchanging this information in a machine-readable events
format using XML, allowing it to be processed using standard tools and
enabling compatibility with other XML-based applications and popular
calendaring applications such as Microsoft Outlook.

Originally a separate EventsML-G2 standard, the Events Calendar and
Scheduling model is now merged with NewsML-G2 to create a single
standard focussed on the needs of a professional news industry
workflow.

NOTE: EventsML-G2 was merged with NewsML-G2 v2.9 (summer
2011). There is the need to express the basic news agenda of "what,
when, where and who" in a machine-readable form that can be processed by
calendar and planning tools.

The related NewsML-G2 Planning Item can be combined with Event
information so that news organisations can plan their response to news
events, such as job assignments, content planning and content
fulfilment, sharing this if required with partners in a workflow. (See
Editorial Planning – the Planning Item)

NewsML-G2 Events may be used to send and receive all, or part of, the
information about:

* a specific news event.
* a range of news events filtered according to some criteria – an event
listing.
* updates to news events.
* people, organisations, objects and other concepts linked to news
events.

[[business-advantages]]
Business Advantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An event managed using NewsML-G2 can serve as the "glue" that binds
together all of the content related to a news story. For example, a news
organisation learns of the imminent merger of two companies. This story
can be pre-planned using Events in NewsML-G2 and assigned a unique Event
ID by the event planning workflow, in the form of a QCode. When content
related to this event is created (text, pictures, graphics, audio, video
and packages), all of the separately-managed content to be associated
using the QCode as a reference.

The result is that when users view content about this story, they can be
provided with navigation to any other related content, or they can
search for the related content.

The NewsML-G2 Events standard is the result of detailed collaborative
work by IPTC experts operating in diverse markets throughout North
America, Europe and Asia Pacific, highly experienced in the planning of
news operations and the issues involved.

Adopters therefore have access to an "off the shelf" data model built on
the specific needs of the news industry that can nevertheless be
extended by individual organisations where necessary to add specialised
features. The Events model is evolving as new requirements become known,
and the IPTC endeavours to main compatibility with previous versions,
giving users a straightforward upgrade path.

The NewsML-G2 Events model complies with the Resource Description
Framework (RDF) promulgated by the W3C, which is a basic building block
of the Semantic Web, and aligns with the iCalendar.

NOTE: A mapping of iCalendar properties to NewsML-G2 properties can be found in the
http://www.newsml-g2.org/spec[NewsML-G2 Specification Page] on the
NewsML-G2 web site. See also http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc5545/[IETF iCalendar Specification
RFC 5545 ] specification that is supported by popular calendar and
scheduling applications such as Microsoft Outlook, Lotus Notes and Apple
iCal.

There is considerable scope for using events planning to improve the
efficiency and quality of news production, since an estimated 50-80% of
news provision is of events that are known about in advance. When a
pre-planned event is accessible from an editorial system, metadata from
the event may be inherited by the news content associated with that
event; this makes the handling of the news faster and more consistent.
There is also an improvement in quality, since the appropriateness and
accuracy of metadata may be checked at the planning stage, rather than
under the pressure of a deadline.

The advantages of using a common standard to promote the efficient
exchange of information are well understood. Using NewsML-G2 Events,
providers can develop planning and scheduling products with greater
confidence that the information can be consumed by their customers;
recipients can cut development costs and time to market for the savings
and services that flow from an efficient resource planning system that
aligns with their operational model.

[[events-structure]]
Events Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Events in NewsML-G2 use the same building blocks as all other NewsML-G2
Items:

* Events use NewsML-G2 identification and versioning properties.
* The <itemMeta> block holds management information about the Item.
* The <contentMeta> block holds common administrative metadata about the
event, or events, conveyed by the NewsML-G2 object.

WARNING: _Please read the Quick Start Guide +
to NewsML-G2 Basics +
before reading this Chapter._

There are two methods for expressing events using NewsML-G2, each suited
to a particular type of information, or application, as shown in Figure
14:

* Persistent event information that will be referenced by other events
and by other NewsML-G2 Items is instantiated as Concept Items containing
an <eventDetails> wrapper, or as members of a set of Event Concepts in a
Knowledge Item. Events expressed as a Concept with a Concept ID are
persistent and can be unambiguously referenced by other Items over time.
* Transient event information that is "standalone" and volatile can be
conveyed in NewsML-G2 using an <events> structure inside a News Item.
Events expressed as an <event> in a News Item have no Concept ID and
cannot be referenced from other Items.

Managed (persistent) events would be appropriate when a provider makes
each of the announced events uniquely identifiable. The event
information can then be stored by the receivers and any updates to
events can be managed. This model also enables content to be linked to
events using the unique event identifier, and this enables linking and
navigation of content related to news stories.

A "standalone" implementation would be used when an organisation
periodically announces to its partners and customers lists of
forthcoming events. These may be for information only and not managed by
the provider. So, for example, a daily list may repeat items that
appeared in a weekly list, but there is no link between them, and
nothing to indicate when an event has been updated.

These differences are illustrated in the following diagram:

[[_Ref220210300]][[_Toc245884544]][[_Toc470002533]]

[[event-information-what-where-when-and-who]]
Event Information – What, Where, When and Who
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a news context, events are newsworthy happenings that may result in
the creation of journalistic content. Since news involves people,
organisations and places, NewsML-G2 has a flexible set of properties
that can convey details of these concepts. There is also a
fully-featured date-time structure to express event occurrences, which
conforms to the iCalendar specification.

[[complete-listing-for-an-example-event]]
Complete Listing for an example Event
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[_Ref468986230]]

The following example shows a news event expressed as a
Concept and conveyed within a Concept Item.

[[_Ref469290727]]

.LISTING: Event sent as a Concept Item

All Scheme Aliases used in listing below indicate IPTC NewsCodes
vocabularies, except for the following alias values: _event, frel,
ventyp._

[source, xml]
----
include::{includedir}/../../GuidelinesCodeExamples_2017/LISTING_14_Event_sent_as_a_Concept_Item.xml[]
----

The top level element of the Concept Item is <conceptItem>. The document
must be uniquely identified using a GUID. By this means, event
information re-sent using the same GUID and an incremented version
number, allows the receiver to manage, update or replace the conveyed
concept (event) information.

@guid and @version uniquely identify the Concept Item, for the purpose
of managing and updating the event information. Items that reference the
event itself MUST use the Concept ID. This is because the Concept ID
uniquely references a persistent Web resource, whereas the GUID only
identifies a document that may or may not persist.

To enable concepts to be identified by a Concept ID QCode, a reference
to the provider’s catalog (or a catalog statement containing the scheme
URI) MUST be included:

[source,xml]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<conceptItem xmlns="http://iptc.org/std/nar/2006-10-01/"
	guid="urn:newsml:iptc.org:20160422:qqwpiruuew4711"
	version="8"
	standard="NewsML-G2"
	standardversion="2.23"
	conformance="power"
	xml:lang="en">
	<catalogRef
		href="http://www.iptc.org/std/catalog/IPTC-G2-standards_27.xml" />
	<catalogRef 
		href="http://www.example.com/events/event-catalog.xml"
/>

In the mandatory <itemMeta> wrapper the IPTC "Nature of Concept Item"
NewsCodes expresses the type of Concept Item. (This is complementary to
the "Nature of News Item" NewsCodes used with a News Item.) There are
currently two values: "concept" and "scheme". (Scheme is used for
Knowledge Items.)

[source,xml]
<itemMeta>
	<itemClass qcode="cinat:concept" />
	<provider qcode="nprov:IPTC" />
	<versionCreated>2016-10-18T13:05:00Z
	</versionCreated>
	<pubStatus qcode="stat:usable" />
</itemMeta>

The Content Metadata for a Concept Item may contain only Administrative
Metadata:

[source,xml]
<contentMeta>
	<urgency>5</urgency>
	<contentCreated>2016-01-16T12:15:00Z</contentCreated>
	<contentModified>2016-06-16T13:35:00Z</contentModified>
</contentMeta>

[[what-is-the-event]]
What is the Event?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to convey event information, we first need to describe "what"
the event is. In NewsML-G2, events MUST have at least one Event Name, a
natural language name for the event. They MAY additionally have one or
more natural language Definitions, properties that describe
characteristics of the event, and Notes.

This Event content is contained in the <concept> wrapper. A Concept Item
has one, and only one, <concept> wrapper. Each Concept must carry a
<conceptId>, a QCode value that will provide a way for other Items to
reference the Concept. The type of concept being conveyed is expressed
using the <type> element with a QCode to tell the receiver that it
contains Event information, using the IPTC "Nature of Concept"
NewsCodes. (The applicable value for an Event Concept is "event")The
Scheme URI is http://http://www.cv.iptc.org/newcodes/cpnature/[cv.iptc.org/newscodes/cpnature/]
and recommended Scheme Alias is "cpnat".

The event information is placed directly inside an <eventDetails>
wrapper:

[source,xml]
<concept>
	<conceptId created="2012-10-16T12:15:00Z" qcode="event:1234567"/>
	<type qcode="cpnat:event" />
	<name>IPTC Autumn Meeting 2016</name>
	<eventDetails>
		...
	</eventDetails>
</concept>
__

The generic properties of Events are similar to those of Concepts,
covered in Concepts and Concept Items. In this framework, we can expand
the "what" information of an Event by indicating one or more
relationships to other events, using the properties of Broader,
Narrower, Related and SameAs. (See xref:event-relationships[Event Relationships])

[[when-does-the-event-take-place]]
When does the Event take place?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "when" of an event uses the Dates wrapper to express the dates and
times of events: the start, end, duration and recurrence.

[source,xml]
<dates>
	<start>2016-10-26T09:00:00Z</start>
	<duration>P2D</duration>
</dates>

Although start and end times may be specified precisely, in the real
world of news, the timing of events is often imprecise. In the early
stages of planning an event, the day, month or even just the year of
occurrence may be the only information available. Providers also need to
be able to indicate a range of dates and/or times of an event, with a
"best guess" at the likely date-time. (See xref:dates-and-times[Dates and times] for
details)

[[where-does-the-event-take-place]]
Where does the Event take place?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "where" of an event is expressed using Location, a rich structure
containing detailed information of the event venue (or venues);
including GPS coordinates, seating capacity, travel routes etc.

[source,xml]
<location>
	<name>86, Edgeware Road, London W2 2EA, United Kingdom</name>
	<related rel="frel:venuetype" qcode="ventyp:confcentre" />
	<POIDetails>
		<position latitude="51.515659" longitude="-0.163346" />
		<contactInfo>
			<web>https://www.etcvenues.co.uk</web>
		</contactInfo>
	</POIDetails>
</location>

Note that if in-depth location details are given in the Event structure,
this is a "one-time" use of the information. This structure might be
better used as part of a controlled vocabulary of locations, in which
case the structures may be copied from a referenced concept containing
the location information.

See xref:further-properties-of-event-details[Further Properties of Event Details] for details of Location and a comprehensive list of other Event properties.

[[who-is-involved]]
Who is involved?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Details of "who" will be present at an event are given using the
Participant property. This can expressed simply using a QCode, URI or
literal value, supplemented by a human-readable Name property, or
optionally using additional properties describing the participants,
their roles at the event, and a wealth of related information.

[source,xml]
<participant qcode="eprol:director">
	<name>Michael Steidl</name>
	<personDetails>
		<contactInfo>
			<email>mdirector@iptc.org</email>
		</contactInfo>
	</personDetails>
</participant>

Note use of the IPTC Event Participant Role New Code (Scheme URI
http://cv.iptc.org/eventparticipantrole/), with recommended Scheme Alias
of "eprol" The event organisers are also an important part of the "who"
of an event. A set of Organiser and Contact Information properties can
give precise details of the people and organisations responsible for an
event, and how to contact them. See xref:further-properties-of-event-details[Further Properties of Event Details] for details

[[event-coverage]]
Event Coverage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NewsML-G2 Planning Item is used to inform customers about content
they can expect to receive and if necessary the disposition of staff and
resources. (see Editorial Planning – the Planning Item).

NOTE: In EventsML-G2 prior to version 1.6, the <eventDetails> wrapper used a
<newsCoverage> child element to convey editorial planning information.
This use of <newsCoverage> is now *DEPRECATED* and the same News Coverage
structure is now available in the Planning Item. One of the many
advantages of this separation is that it allows frequent updates to
Planning to be sent without affecting the Event Concept to which it
refers.]

The link between an Event and the optional Planning Item is created
using the Event ID. The Planning Item conveys information about the
content that is planned in response to the Event, including the types of
content and quantities (e.g. expected number of pictures). The Planning
Item also has a Delivery structure which enables the tracking and
fulfilment of content related to an Event.

[[event-properties-in-more-detail]]
Event Properties in more detail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples below show the basic properties of events, starting with
the Name and Definition of the event, with other descriptive details,
moving on to show how relationships, location, dates and other details
may be expressed.

[[event-description]]
Event Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the code sample that follows, we will begin to create an event using
four properties:

* Event Name is an internationalised string giving a natural language
name of the event. More than one may be used, for example if the Name is
expressed in multiple languages.
* Definitions, two differentiated by @role ("short" and "long") will be
created using the Block element template (which allows some mark-up).
* Notes – also Block type elements – give some additional natural
language information, which is not naturally part of the event
definition, again using @role if required.
* Using Related, the nature of the Event can be refined and other
properties of an Event can be expressed.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Type |Notes/Example
|<name> |Intl String a|
[source,xml]
<name xml:lang="en">
	Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee
</name>

|<definition> |Block a|
[source,xml]
<definition xml:lang="en" role="definitionrole:short">
	Monthly meeting of the Bank of England committee 
	that decides on bank lending rates for the UK.
</definition>
<definition xml:lang="en" role="definitionrole:long">
	The Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee meets each 
	month to decide on the minimum rate of interest that will 
	be charged for inter-bank lending in the UK financial 
	markets. <br />
</definition>

|<related> |Flexible a|
The nature of the event, and other information. The property is
repeatable and may have a @rel attribute to indicate the relationship to
the characteristic. Relationships can be expressed using:

* a QCode referencing a controlled vocabulary of (for example) event
types, such as "meeting", "parliamentary session", "music concert";
another could qualify the nature of the event with codes to indicate
whether the event is "open to the public" or "private".

[source,xml]
<related qcode="eventrel:meeting" />

* a URI

[source,xml]
<related uri="http://www.example.com/meeting" />

* a set of attributes to represent some arbitrary value.

[source,xml]
<related rel="csrel:admission" value="7.0" valueunit="iso4217:EUR"
	valuedatatype="xs:decimal" />

|<note> |Block a|
A repeatable natural language note of additional information about the
event, with an optional @role:

[source,xml]
<note role="noterole:toeditors">
	Note to editors: an embargoed press release of the +
	minutes of the meeting will be released by the COI +
	within two weeks.
</note>
<note role="noterole:general">
	The meeting was delayed by two days due to illness.
</note>

|=======================================================================

[[event-relationships]]
Event Relationships
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Large news events may be split into a series of smaller, manageable
events, arranged in a hierarchy which can express parent-child and peer
relationships.

A "master" event may be notionally split into sub-events, which in turn
may be split into further sub-events without limit. Each event instance
can be managed separately yet handled and conveyed within the context of
the larger realm of events of which it forms a part using the concept
relationships <broader>, <narrower>, <related> and <sameAs> relationship
properties.

image:media/image17.wmf[image,width=636,height=391]

[[_Ref220475900]][[_Toc245884545]][[_Toc470002534]]Figure 15: Hierarchy
of Events created using Event Relationships

It is important to note from the above diagram that Broader, Narrower
and Same As have specific relationships to the same type of Concept that
is in this case Events. Related has no such restriction. thus:

* Aquatics is Broader than Breast Stroke or Swimming or Diving, but not
Opening Speech.
* Diving is Narrower than Aquatics, but not Archery.
* Aquatics may be the Same As Aquatics in some other taxonomy, but not
necessarily the Same As Swimming or Diving in some other taxonomy.
* Breast Stroke may be Related to an Event, a Person or other Concept
Type.

The examples below show the use of the event relationship properties for
the fictional Economic Policy Committee event:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Type |Notes/Example
|<broader> |Flexible Property (CCL)/Related Concept (PCL) a|
Repeatable. The event may be part of another event, in which case this
can be denoted by <broader>.

[source,xml]
<broader
	type="cpnat:event" qcode="events:TR2012-34625">
	<name>Olympic Swimming Gala</name>
</broader>

|<narrower> |Flexible Property/ Related Concept (PCL) a|
Repeatable. May be used to indicate that the event has related child
events. In this case we want to notify the receiver that a child of this
event is the scheduled medal ceremony.

[source,xml]
<narrower qcode="events:TR2012-34593">
	<name>Men’s 100m Freestyle Medal Ceremony</name>
</narrower>

|<related> |Flexible Property/ Related Concept (PCL) a|
Repeatable. May be used to denote a relationship to another concept or
event. In this case, we want to link the event to an organisation which
is not a participant, but may later form part of the coverage of the
event. We qualify the relationship using @rel and the IPTC Item Relation
NewsCodes:

[source,xml]
<related
	rel="irel:seeAlso"
	type="cpnat:organisation"
	qcode="org:asa">
	<name>Amateur Swimming association</name>
</related>

|<sameAs> |Flexible Property/ Related Concept (PCL) a|
Repeatable. May be used to denote that this event is the same event in
another taxonomy, for example another governing body’s taxonomy of
events:

[source,xml]
<sameAs qcode="iocevent:xxxxxx">
	<name>Men’s 100m Freestyle</name>
</sameAs>

|=======================================================================

[[event-details-group]]
Event Details Group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first set of properties of Event Details is date-time information as
described below. The further properties are described in
xref:further-properties-of-event-details[Further Properties of Event Details]

[[dates-and-times]]
Dates and times
++++++++++++++++

The IPTC intends that event dates and times in NewsML-G2 align with the
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545[iCalendar] (iCal) specification. This
does not mean that dates and times are expressed in the same FORMAT as
iCalendar, but the implementation of NewsML-G2 properties that match
iCalendar properties should be as set forth in the iCalendar
specification.

The end dates/times of events are _non-inclusive_. Therefore a one day
event on September 14, 2011 would have a _start date_ (2011-09-14) and
would have EITHER an _end date_ of September 15 (2011-09-15) OR a
_duration_ of one day (syntax: see in table below).

The NewsML-G2 syntax for expressing start and end times of events is a
valid calendar date with optional time and offset; the following are
valid:

* 2011-09-22T22:32:00Z (UTC)
* 2011-09-22T22:32:00-0500
* 2011-09-22

The following are NOT valid:

* 2011-09 (incomplete)
* 2011-09-22T22:32Z (if time is used, all parts MUST be present.
* 2011-09-22T22:32:00 (if time is used, time zone MUST be present.

When specifying the duration of an event, the date-part values permitted
by iCalendar are W(eeks) and D(ays). In XML Schema, the only permitted
date-part values are Y(ears), M(onths) and D(ays). (The permitted time
parts H(ours), M(inutes) and S(econds) are the same in both XML Schema
and iCalendar.)

The following table shows the permitted values for date-part in both
standards

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===============================
|Duration |XML Schema |iCalendar
|D(ays) |icon:check[role="green"] |icon:check[role="green"]
|W(eeks) |icon:close[role="red"]|icon:check[role="green"]
|M(onths) |icon:check[role="green"]|icon:close[role="red"]
|Y(ears) |icon:check[role="green"] |icon:close[role="red"]
|===============================

Since NewsML-G2 uses XML Schema Duration, ONLY the values listed as
permitted under the XML Schema column can be used, and therefore W(eeks)
MUST NOT be used.

In addition the IPTC recommends that to promote inter-operability with
applications that use the iCalendar standard, Y(ears) or M(onths) SHOULD
NOT be used; only D(ays) should be used for the date part of duration
values.

Duration units can be combined, in descending order from left to right, for example:

* P2D (duration of 2 days)
* P1DT3H (1 day and 3 hours – note the "T" separator)

iCalendar specifies that if the start date of an event is expressed as a
Calendar date with no time element, then the end date MUST be to the
_same_ scale (i.e. no time) or if using duration, the ONLY permitted
values are W(eeks) or D(ays). In this case, only D(ays) may be used in
NewsML-G2.

The following table lists the date-time properties of events details:

[cols="20,20,60",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Type |Notes/Example
|<start> |Approximate Date Time a|
Mandatory, non-repeatable property has two optional attributes,
@approxstart and @approxend.

The date part may be truncated, starting on the right (days) according
to the precision required, but MUST, at minimum, have a year, for
example:

[source,xml]
<start>2011-06-12T12:30:00Z</start>

or

[source,xml]
<start>2011-06-12</start>

NOTE: If used, the time must be present in full, with time zone, and ONLY in
the presence of the full date.

The value of <start> expresses the precise date-time of the start of the
event. With the information available, this might be a "best guess".

By using @approxstart and @approxend it is possible to qualify the start
date-time by indicating the range of date-times within which the start
will fall. (Note: these are NOT the approximate start and end of the
_event_ itself, only the range of _start date-times_)

@approxstart indicates the start of the range. If used on its own, the
end of the range of dates is the date-time value of <start>

For example, a possible start of an event on June 12, 2011, not before
June 11, 2011, and no later than June 14 2011, would be expressed as:

[source,xml]
<start
	approxstart="2011-06-11"
	approxend="2011-06-14">
	2011-06-12
</start>

|<end> |Approximate Date Time a|
Non-repeatable element to indicate the _non-inclusive_ end time of the
event, and optionally a range of values in which it may fall, using the
same property type and syntax as for <start>

The <dates> wrapper may contain either an <end> date, or a <duration>
but not both. A non-inclusive <end> date means, for example, that a
one-day event starting on November 12, 2012 would have an end date of
November 13, 2012.

|<duration> |XML Schema Duration a|
Non-repeatable. The time period during which the event takes place is
expressed in the form:

`PnYnMnDTnHnMnS`

`P` indicates the Period (required)

`nY` = number of Years^*^

`nM` = number of Months^*^

`nD` = number of Days

`T` indicates the start of the Time period (required if a time part is specified)

`nH` = number of Hours

`nM` = number of Minutes

`nS` = number of Seconds

^*^ The IPTC recommends that these units should NOT be used.

Example:

[source,xml]
<duration>PT3H</duration>

The event will last for three hours. Note use of the "T" time separator
even though no Date part is present.

The <dates> wrapper may contain either an <end> date, or a <duration>
but not both.

|<confirmation> |QCode a|
Optional, non-repeatable. A QCode indicating whether the date-times for
the event are confirmed or subject to possible change. There is a
recommended IPTC Event Date Confirmation NewsCodes (Scheme URI
http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/eventdateconfirm/) with a recommended
Scheme alias of "edconf" which currently has three possible values:

[source,xml]
<confirmation

[[recurrence-properties]]
Recurrence Properties

This is a group of optional properties that may be used to specify the
recurring instances of an event, and conforms to the iCalendar
specification, including the use of the same enumerated values for
properties such as Frequency (@freq). Recurrence MUST be expressed using
EITHER

`<rDate>`: one or more explicit date-times that the event is repeated, OR

`<rRule>`: one or more rules of recurrence.

[cols="20,20,60",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|[[OLE_LINK9]]Property |Type |Notes/Example
|<rDate> |Date with optional Time a|
Recurrence Date. Repeatable. If the recurrence occurs on a specific
date, with an optional time part, or on several specific dates and
times.

[source,xml]
<rdate>2011-03-27T14:00:00Z</rdate>
<rdate>2011-04-03T16:00:00Z</rdate>

|<rRule> |Recurrence Rule a|
Repeatable. The property has a number of attributes that may be used to
define the rules of recurrence for the event.

The only mandatory attribute is @freq, an enumerated string denoting the
frequency of recurrence.

[source,xml]
<rRule freq="MONTHLY" />

The enumerated values of @freq are:

* YEARLY
* MONTHLY
* DAILY
* HOURLY
* PER MINUTE
* PER SECOND

@interval indicates how often the rule repeats as a positive integer.
The default is "1" indicating that for example, an event with a
frequency of DAILY is repeated EACH day. To repeat an event every four
years, such as the Summer Olympics, the Frequency would be set to
‘YEARLY" with an Interval of "4":

[source,xml]
<rRule
	freq="YEARLY"
	interval="4"
/>

@until sets a Date with optional Time _after_ which the recurrence rule
expires:

[source,xml]
<rRule
	freq="MONTHLY"
	until="2011-12-31"
/>

@count indicates the number of occurrences of the rule. For example, an
event taking place daily for seven days would be expressed as:

[source,xml]
<rRule
	freq="DAILY"
	count="7"
/>

A group of @byxxx attributes (as per the iCalendar BYxxx properties) are
evaluated after @freq and @interval to further determine the occurrences
of an event: @bymonth, @byweekno, @byyearday, @bymonthday, @byday,
@byhour, @byminute, @bysecond, @bysetpos.

The following code and explanation is based on an example from the
iCalendar Specification at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5545.txt

[source,xml]
<start>2011-01-11T8:30:00Z</start>
	<rRule
	freq="YEARLY"
	interval="2"
	bymonth="1"
	byday="SU" 
	byhour="8 9"
	byminute="30"
/>

First, the interval="2" would be applied to freq="YEARLY" to arrive at
"every other year". Then, bymonth="1" would be applied to arrive at
"every January, every other year". Then, byday="SU" would be applied to
arrive at "every Sunday in January, every other year".

Then, byhour="8 9" (note that all multiple values are space separated)
would be applied to arrive at "every Sunday in January at 8am and 9am,
every other year". Then, byminute="30" would be applied to arrive at
"every Sunday in January at 8:30am and 9:30am, every other year". Then,
lacking information from rRule, the second is derived from <start>, to
end up in "every Sunday in January at 8:30:00am and 9:30:00am, every
other year".

Similarly, if any of the @byminute, @byhour, @byday, @bymonthday or
@bymonth rule part were missing, the appropriate minute, hour, day or
month would have been retrieved from the <start> property.

The @bysetpos attribute contains a non-zero integer "n" between ‑366 and
366 to specify the nth occurrence within a set of events specified by
the rule. Multiple values are space separated. It can only be used with
other @by* attributes.

For example, a rule specifying monthly on any working day would be

[source,xml]
<rRule
	freq="MONTHLY"
	byday="MO TU WE TH FR"

/>

The same rule to specify the last working day of the month would be

[source,xml]
<rRule
	freq="MONTHLY"
	byday="MO TU WE TH FR"
	bypos="-1"
/>

@wkst indicates the day on which the working week starts using
enumerated values corresponding to the first two letters of the days of
the week in English, for example "MO" (Monday), SA (Saturday), as
specified by iCalendar.

[source,xml]
<rRule
	freq="WEEKLY"
	wkst="MO" />

|<exDate> |Date with optional Time a|
Excluded Date of Recurrence. An explicit Date or Dates, with optional
Time, excluded from the Recurrence rule. For example, if a regular
monthly meeting coincides with public holidays, these can be excluded
from the recurrence set using <exDate>

[source,xml]
<rRule
	freq="MONTHLY"
	until="2011-12-31"
/>
<exDate>
	2011-04-06
</exDate>

|<exRule> |Recurrence Rule a|
Excluded Recurrence Rule. The same attributes as <rRule> may be used to
create a rule for excluding dates from a recurring series of events. For
example, a regular weekly meeting may be suspended during the summer.

[source,xml]
<rRule
	freq="WEEKLY"
	until="2011-07-23"
/>
<rRule
	freq="WEEKLY"
	until="2011-12-24"
/>
<exRule
	freq="WEEKLY"
	until="2011-09-03"
/>

Note the order of the above statement: the <rRule> elements must come
before <exRule>

The meaning being expressed is:

"The event occurs weekly until Dec 24, 2011 with a break from after July
23, 2011 until September 3, 2011."

Editorial Planning – the Planning Item])

|=======================================================================

[[contact-information]]
Contact Information
+++++++++++++++++++

Contact information associated solely with the event, not any organiser
or participant. For example, events often have a special web site and an
event office which is independent of the organisers’ permanent web site
or office address.

The <contactInfo> element wraps a structure with the properties outlined
below. An event may have many instances of <contactInfo>, each with
@role indicating the purpose. These are controlled values, so a provider
may create their own CV of address types if required, or use the IPTC
Event Contact Info Role NewsCodes, which has values of "general
contact", "media contact", ticketing contact".

Each of the child elements of <contactInfo> may be repeated as often as
needed to express different @roles, for example different "public" and
"press" email addresses etc.

[cols="20,20,60",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Type |Notes/Example
|<email> |Electronic Address a|
An "Electronic Address" type allows the expression of @role (QCode) to
qualify the information, for example

[source,xml]
<email role="addressrole:press">
	office@iptc.org
</email>

|<im> |Electronic Address a|

[source,xml]
<im role="imsrvc:reuters">
	jdoe.iptc.org@reuters.net
</im>

|<phone> |Electronic Address a|
Repeatable. Phone numbers should have a @role if necessary distinguish
between different numbers:

[source,xml]
<phone role="phrole:public">
	1-123-456-7899
</phone>
<phone role="phrole:press">
	1-123-456-7898
</phone>

|<fax> |Electronic Address |Fax number(s), as described for <phone>
above.

|<web> |IRI a|
[source,xml]
<web role="webrole:event">
	www.iptc.org/springmeeting.html
</web>

|<address> |Address |See xref:address-details-address[Address details]  for details of Address properties.
The Address may have a @role to denote the type of address is contains
(e.g. office, personal) and may be repeated as required to express each
address @role.

|<note> |Block |Any other contact-related information, such as "Office
closed for lunch from 12.30pm for three hours"
|=======================================================================

[[address-details-address]]
Address details <address>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Address Type property may have a @role to indicate its purpose; the
following table shows the available child properties. Apart from <line>,
which is repeatable, each element may be used once for each <address>

[cols="20,20,60",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Type |Notes/Example
|<line> |Internationalized string |As many as are needed

|<locality> |Flexible Property |For example, name of a town or suburb.
May be a URI, QCode, or no value with optional <name> child element

|<area> |Flexible Property |For example, a county or region with
optional <name> child element

|<country> |Flexible Property |The country with optional <name> child
element

|<postalCode> |Internationalized String |The postal code, zip code or

	<postalCode>WC2E 9BT</postalCode>
</address>


[[multiple-event-concepts-in-a-knowledge-item]]
Multiple Event Concepts in a Knowledge Item
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Information about multiple events can be assembled in a Knowledge Item,
which conveys a set of one or more Concepts. In this example, we will
use a Knowledge Item to convey two related events.

The top-level <knowledgeItem> element contains identification, version
and catalog information, in common with other NewsML-G2 Items:

[source,xml]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<knowledgeItem xmlns="http://iptc.org/std/nar/2006-10-01/"
	guid="urn:newsml:iptc.org:20110126:qqwpiruuew4712"

	<catalogRef href="http://www.iptc.org/std/catalog/IPTC-G2-Standards_29.xml" />
	<catalogRef href="http://www.example.com/events/event-catalog.xml"
/>

The <itemMeta> block conveys Management Metadata about the document and
the <contentMeta> block can convey Administrative Metadata about the
concepts being conveyed, and in this case we can show Descriptive
Metadata that is common to all of the concepts in the Knowledge item,

The Core Descriptive Metadata properties common to all NewsML-G2 Items
that may be used in a Knowledge Item are: <language>, <keyword>,
<subject>, <slugline>, <headline> and <description>.

[source,xml]
<itemMeta>
	<itemClass qcode="cinat:concept" />
	<provider qcode="nprov:IPTC" />

	</subject>
	<subject qcode="medtop:20000763">
		<name>IT/computer sciences</name>
	</subject>
</contentMeta>

The two events in the listing are related, with the relationship
indicated by the second event using the <broader> property to show that
it is an event which is part of the three-day event listed first

First event:

[source,xml]
<conceptSet>
	<concept>
	<!-- FIRST EVENT! -->
		<conceptId created="2016-10-26T12:15:00Z" qcode="event:1234567" />
		<name>IPTC Autumn Meeting 2016</name>
		<eventDetails>
	...

Second event: a session on news gathering and verification below
(event:91011123) has a ‘broader’ relationship to the IPTC Autumn Meeting
above (event:1234567).

[source,xml]
<concept>

When multiple Events are conveyed as Concepts in a Knowledge Item, and a

<partMeta> helper element to inform customers WHAT has changed in the
new version of the Knowledge Item.

The <partMeta> element uses the standard XML ID/IDREF; the example shows
the Event with @id="eventA" was modified on ‘2016-09-15’, as indicated
by the Part Meta with @contentrefs="eventA":

</knowledgeItem>

[[conveying-events-in-a-newsml-g2-package]]
Conveying Events in a NewsML-G2 Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A news provider may wish to create a service that consists of
collections of events that are significant to a specific editorial
theme, for example, this could be the day’s Top Finance Events.

When such Events are available as Concept Items, they may be referenced
in a Package using <itemRef> and @residref. (See the Quick Start -
Packages chapter for details of the Package Item structure and Item
references)

Alternatively, because they are managed and persistent Events identified
using URIs, or their short format QCodes, collections of event concepts
may be referenced within a Package <group> using Concept Reference
<conceptRef> as follows:

[source,xml]
<groupSet root="G1">
	<group id="G1" role="group:main">
	...
	<conceptRef type="cinat:event"
		qcode="iptcevents:20081007135637.12">
			<name xml:lang="fr">Barack Obama arrive à Washington</name>
	</conceptRef>
	...
	</group>
</groupSet>

Note the optional @type indicating that the referenced concept is an
Event, and the optional <name> child element is a natural-language name
for the event extracted from the concept being referenced.

Note the following guidelines on packaging Event Concepts:

* "Hint" properties – these are properties extracted from the original
concept and conveyed with the reference to the concept – are restricted
to <name> only when using <conceptRef>. When using <itemRef>, ANY
property may be extracted from the referenced Concept Item.
* The provider must take care that "Hint" properties do not re-define
the original concept. When a provider distributes concepts using Concept
Items or Knowledge Items, changes to the original concept MUST be issued
via an updated Concept Item and/or Knowledge Item and if a @version is
used with the <itemRef>, @residref must be updated to correspond with
the revised concept’s version.
* If for the referenced concept a Concept Item is available then this
concept’s Item MAY be referenced by <itemRef>; this is the preferred
option. This MAY include Hint properties copied from the Concept Item.
* If for the referenced concept a Concept Item is available then this
concept MAY be referenced using <conceptRef> as a valid alternative
option, for example when a package includes a mix of concepts for which
some Concept Items are available and some are not available, but the
provider wants to express the references in a consistent way. However,
in a case such as this the constraint on the use of Hints has to be
accepted.
* If for a referenced concept there is no Concept Item and only a URI as
identifier is available, then <conceptRef> MUST be used; no Hint
properties, except a name, are available as there is no Concept Item
available as a source for copying Hints.

The standard method for exchanging concept information in the NewsML-G2
context is the Knowledge Item, which is a container for concepts and the
detailed properties of each concept being conveyed. A provider would use
Knowledge Items to send comprehensive information about many events, and
receivers might incorporate this information into their own editorial
diary, or Day Book.

By contrast, when a Package is employed to reference Event concepts,
this represents an Editorial product, in which a discrete number of
events considered to be significant or pertinent to a particular topic,
are selected and published.

The Events Package has the following characteristics:

* The value of the package is in the journalistic judgement used to
select the events, not in the compilation of the event information
itself.
* When using <conceptRef>, the package is a lightweight container that
references each event and a human-readable name; no further details of
the events are given. In this case, the package is transient in nature:
it will not be referenced over time except as an archived item of
editorial content.
* It may be ordered to indicate the relative significance of the events
in the context of the package, but no other relationship between the
events is expressed or implied.
* New versions of the Package may be published; events may be replaced
or deleted from the package, but details of the events themselves cannot
be changed.

The characteristics of a KI are:

* It represents Knowledge; the value is in the compilation of the
details about each event in the KI: the "when and where" and other
practical information about each event.
* The KI contains persistent information about each event concept that
may be expected to be frequently used and if necessary updated over
time.
* The concepts in the KI cannot be ordered, but may be related.
* New versions of the KI can be published and the concepts that it
contains can be updated, but they must not be deleted, as this would
break existing references to the concepts.

[[events-workflow]]
Events Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the flow diagram shown below, the News Provider creates and compiles
event information and publishes it in a Knowledge Item. The Customer’s
events management system subscribes to this information.

Later, the News Provider’s editorial team reviews the events database
and creates an ordered list of the "Top Ten" news events of the day. The
News Provider publishes the list as a Package Item. The Package Item is
ingested by the Customer’s editorial system, and the Customer’s
journalists use it as a guide in planning the news coverage of the day,
looking up details of each event (hosted in the Knowledge Item) as
needed.

[[events-in-a-news-item]]
Events in a News Item
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many news providers, particularly news agencies, provide their customers
with event information as a list of events, for example a list of
cultural events taking place in a city’s theatres. In many cases, these
were provided as a text story, with minimal mark-up.

Conveying these events in a News Item as described below can be useful,
as the structured mark-up enables them to be re-formatted by software,
for example as tables or listings in print and online media. Note,
however, that this is a limited and specific use case; events in this
form are NOT persistent, and cannot be managed as part of the News
Planning process (as described in Editorial Planning – the Planning
Item).

The Content Set of the Events News Item uses the <inlineXML> element to

[[adding-event-concept-details-to-a-news-item]]
Adding event concept details to a News Item
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Expressing Events as Concepts in a Concept Item gives implementers great
scope for including and/or referencing events information in other
Items, such as News Items conveying content. This is achieved by adding
the event as a <subject> element of the <contentMeta> container. For
example in 0 an event was conveyed as a concept within the Concept Set
of a Knowledge Item:

[source,xml]
<knowledgeItem
	...>
	<conceptSet>
		<concept>
		<!-- FIRST EVENT! -->
		<!-- -->
			<conceptId created="2016-01-16T12:15:00Z" qcode="event:1234567" />
			<name>IPTC Autumn Meeting 2016</name>
			<eventDetails> 
				...
			</eventDetails>
	...
</knowledgeItem>

The QCode event:1234567 uniquely identifies the event, and later news
coverage of the event can reference it using the <subject> element, as
shown below:

[source,xml]
<newsItem
	...>
	<contentMeta>
		...
		<subject type="cpnat:event" qcode="event:12345657">
			<name>IPTC Autumn Meeting 2016</name>
		</subject>
		...
	</contentMeta>
	...
</newsItem>

Referencing an event using Subject enables News Items to be searched
and/or grouped by event, and also helps end-users manage the content for
events with a wide coverage and many delivered Items.

[[using-bag-to-create-a-composite-concept]]
Using <bag> to create a composite concept
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Providers can put an event and related concepts together to create a new
composite concept using a <bag> child element of <subject>.

For example, a financial news service sends a News Item conveying
content about a takeover of a small company by a larger global company.
This takeover story has an event concept, which enables the provider to
add a subject property containing the QCode of the Event:

[source,xml]
<subject type="cpnat:event" qcode="finevent:takeover123AB" />

... together with subject properties for each company:

[source,xml]
<subject type="cpnat:organisation" qcode="isin:SmallCompany" />
<subject type="cpnat:organisation" qcode="isin:GlobalCompany" />

However, a new, richer, composite concept combining the concept IDs for
the Event _and_ the two companies could be created instead using <bag>:

[source,xml]
<newsItem ...>
	...
	<contentMeta>
		...
		<subject type="cpnat:abstract">
			<name>GlobalCompany takes over SmallCompany</name>
			<bag>
				<bit type="cpnat:event" qcode="finevent:takeover123AB" />
				<bit type="cpnat:organisation" qcode="isin:SmallCompany" />
				<bit type="cpnat:organisation" qcode="isin:GlobalCompany" />
			</bag>
		</subject>
		...
	</contentMeta>
	...
</newsItem>

Note that in this case, the <subject> does _not_ have its own +
identifier; these properties must NOT be used when <subject> +
has a <bag> element

[[using-significance-with-bag]]
Using @significance with <bag>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An advantage of using the composite structure of <bag> is that
implementers can "fine tune" the subject properties using @significance.
This enables receiving applications to be more discerning on behalf of
end-users, about how they filter and select news.

The significance of an event to all the concepts in a <bag> is not
necessarily equal: for an end-user interested in news about a _small_
company, the fact that it has been taken over by a large company is very
significant. To the follower of news about the _large_ company, the
story may be less significant.

The code snippet below shows how the significance attribute would be
used to refine the previous example, such that the event is more
significant to the SmallCompany (100) compared to the GlobalCompany (10):

[source,xml]
<subject type="cpnat:abstract">
	<name>GlobalCompany takes over SmallCompany</name>
	<bag>
		<bit type="cpnat:event" qcode="finevent:takeover123AB" />
		<bit type="cpnat:organisation" qcode="isin:SmallCompany" significance="100"/>
		<bit type="cpnat:organisation" qcode="isin:GlobalCompany" significance="10"/>
	</bag>
</subject>

NOTE: The <bag> MUST contain one <bit> of type "cpnat:event" +
This feature was added from NewsML-G2 2.7 onwards. ONLY for the special
case where the <bag> contains a <bit> referencing an event, may a
@significance attribute be added to the other <bit> members of the
<bag>.
