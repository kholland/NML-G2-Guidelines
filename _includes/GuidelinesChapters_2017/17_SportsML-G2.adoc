Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This guide refers to SportsML-G2 v3.0. For implementation of earlier
versions of SportsML refer to earlier versions of these guidelines.
Please visit
https://iptc.org/standards/sportsml-g2/[iptc.org/standards/sportsml-g2]
for further links to SportsML-G2 resources. There is also a SportsML-G2
user group forum at https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/sportsml/info
for all those interested in SportsML-G2 wishing to seek advice and share
experiences.

Sports fixtures and results have long been an important part of the
output of news agencies and media organisations and this activity
continues to grow in line with the increasing world-wide interest in
sport.

Historically, providers had to balance the need for detailed information
with the constraints imposed by having to deliver timely transmissions
of data over the (then) low-speed data circuits available. This led to
sparse plain text or field-delimited data feeds that required precise
formatting and processing in order to produce the required output, which
was driven by the space constraints of print media.

Today, the picture is very different. The rise of the Web combined with
the emergence of a global sports industry has created a demand for more
detailed results and statistics. Although timeliness remains a key
priority, modern communications and processing power have removed many
of the old restrictions.

The legacy formats are therefore no longer adequate, but if the response
to modern needs is a proliferation of specialised data formats, this
will over time make the exchange and application of sports data more
costly and difficult.

SportsML-G2 is designed to offer a flexible, extensible framework built
on the re-usable components of NewsML-G2 that can handle all types of
sports information using standard technology, including:

* Schedules (fixtures)
* Results
* Multi-media sports news
* Standings (for example league tables, player order-of-merit, rankings)
* Team statistics, including actions such as "fumbles", "tackles"
* Player statistics, including career statistics and play statistics.
* Match statistics, including "plays", or "actions"
* Betting or wagering information
* Venue information, including weather

Rather than try to fit all sports into a single generic model, special
add-in modules enable widely-differing sports, such as golf, baseball
and motor racing, to be accommodated within the standard framework.

[[business-advantages-1]]
Business Advantages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NewsML-G2 data model is well suited to the exchange of sports
information. By its nature, sport has many entities: teams, players,
officials, leagues and so on that are routinely stored as structured
data and can be used, updated, and re-used over time. These can be
exchanged as Concepts and Knowledge Items.

Sports Events may therefore be modelled as actions and relationships
involving these known entities, and by coding these in XML, the full
value of this information can be harnessed using standard technology:

* Information can be easily imported into databases
* Using XSLT information can be transformed to specific format for the
Web, print, mobile etc, or other XML formats.
* The information can be used directly by dynamic applications using
Java or similar tools.
* Providers and receivers are not restricted in their choice of
taxonomies. This is crucial in sport where value-added knowledge bases
may be maintained by different data owners.
* Extension points allow the standard to be adapted and customised to
special needs within the standard framework

Finally, by building expertise around a single, extensible standard,
information owners, providers, and consumers can benefit from reduced
costs, greater reliability and faster time-to-market for compelling
applications based on the rich variety of sports statistics and content
that is increasingly available.

[[structure]]
Structure
~~~~~~~~~

SportsML-G2 content is conveyed within NewsML-G2 Items, (that is News
Items, Package Items, Concept Items, Knowledge Items and Planning
Items).

The structure of a SportsML-G2 document conveying a single piece of
content, or multiple renditions of the same content, matches that of a
NewsML-G2 News Item, as shown in Figure 18.

The <newsItem>, <itemMeta> and <contentMeta> components are implemented
as discussed in Quick Start: NewsML-G2 Basics, which readers are
encouraged to study first. Although a full description of all of the
many features of SportsML-G2 is beyond the scope of this Guide, this
Chapter documents the implementation of specific SportsML-G2 features
and shows by example how its use may be extended.

[[_Ref221010865]][[_Toc470002537]]Figure 18: Structure of a SportsML-G2
document matches NewsML-G2

As shown in the diagram, the <contentSet> wrapper appropriate to
SportsML-G2 is <inlineXML>, which wraps valid XML content.

[[xml-schema-and-catalogs]]
XML Schema and Catalogs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The schema used by the <newsItem> wrapper is NewsML-G2, although the
document is conveying SportsML-G2, because a NewsML-G2 <newsItem> is
being used to convey the information. Starting with version 3
SportsML-G2 uses the same namespace as NewsML-G2 so the SportsML child
elements of the <inlineXML> wrapper of the document are from the same
namespace.

The @standard is "NewsML-G2" and the appropriate @version value should
reflect the version of NewsML-G2 being used, in the examples it is
"2.25". If the Power Conformance Level is being used, the @conformance
attribute MUST be present with a value of "power"

The Catalog references for a SportsML-G2 document are more likely to
contain references to proprietary, or non-IPTC, catalogs. The IPTC
Catalog, or those IPTC schemes that are mandatory, MUST be referenced.
The IPTC Subject NewsCodes also have a comprehensive classification of
sports, and the IPTC recommends their use as an aid to
inter-operability.

Other provider-specific catalogs may be referenced. In the examples in
this Chapter, we will use references to catalogs provided by kind
permission of XML Team (http://www.xmlteam.com[www.xmlteam.com]), an
IPTC member and a specialist provider of sports information, and also a
leading contributor to the SportsML community. Note that catalogs can be
referenced using <catalogRef> and @href to a catalog file, and/or the
<catalog> element may be used to reference the controlled vocabulary
(scheme) using the <scheme> child element with @alias and @uri
attributes.

<catalogRef
href="http://www.iptc.org/std/catalog/catalog.IPTC-G2-Standards_29.xml"
/>

<catalog>

<scheme alias="fixture"
uri="http://xmlteam.org/newscodes/fixture#" />

</catalog>

[[item-metadata-2]]
Item Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A typical <itemMeta> block may include the following:

<itemMeta>

<itemClass qcode="ninat:text"/>

<provider qcode="web:www.xmlteam.com"/>

<versionCreated>2016-10-19T16:00:00Z</versionCreated>

<pubStatus qcode="stat:usable"/>

<fileName>xt.5932656-preview.xml</fileName>

</itemMeta>

Note that it contains a recommended <filename> for the item.

[[content-metadata-2]]
Content Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following <contentMeta> block, the provider expresses the
following facts about the content:

* When it was created
* Where the content was created
* Who created the content (note, not necessarily the provider of the
SportsML-G2 document â€“ see <provider> in Item Metadata)
* Alternative Identifiers for the content. Two will be given in the
example, and the NewsML-G2 Specification recommends that they be
distinguished using @type.
* The genre of the content, in this case a preview of a major league
baseball fixture. In the example it is expressed more than once, using
different controlled vocabularies.
* What, or whom, the content is about, including the fixture, teams and
players, plus the classification of the sport (in this case using the
IPTC Media Topic NewsCodes)

</contentMeta>

[[inlinexml-and-the-sports-content-component]]
InlineXML and the Sports Content component
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Up to this point in the example, NewsML-G2 components have been re-used
"as is" with minor variations. SportsML-G2 is a mark-up language
specifically for sport, therefore as one might expect, it has structures
and properties appropriate to those needs.

This becomes clear in the <contentSet> component. The content will be
conveyed as SportsML-G2. The appropriate wrapper for this type of
content is <inlineXML>.

<contentSet>

<inlineXML contenttype="application/sportsml+xml">

<sports-content>

The Inline XML wrapper must contain a complete XML document from any
namespace â€“ in this case <sports-content> is the root element of a
SportsML-G2 document. From version 3 on SportsML uses the same namespace
as NewsML-G2.

The optional child elements <sports-metadata> and <article> are not
documented here. The contents of <sports-metadata> have migrated to the
<itemMeta> and <contentMeta> components, and <article> may be conveyed
as a text using NewsML-G2.

It may be noted that the SportsML-G2 properties do not adhere to the
NewsML-G2 convention of using "camel case" names (for example
<sports-event> is used, not <sportsEvent>. This is to maintain backward
compatibility with previous versions of SportsML, which existed as a
standalone format before the creation of NewsML-G2.

Sports Content may hold the following child elements

[[schedules-or-fixtures-schedule]]
Schedules or Fixtures <schedule>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A series of games, usually grouped by date. Also known as a fixture
list.

[[sports-event-sports-event]]
Sports Event <sports-event>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Contains metadata and data about a sporting competition â€“ a sporting
content that generally ends with a winner

[[standing-standing]]
Standing <standing>
+++++++++++++++++++

A series of team or individual records; facts about a team or playerâ€™s
performances during a match, competition, season or career,

[[statistics-tables-statistic]]
Statistics, Tables <statistic>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A table comparing the performance of teams or players, such as a league
table, order of merit, world ranking. Regular statistics may be linked
to fixtures or competitions using a QCode.

[[tournament-tournament]]
Tournament <tournament>
+++++++++++++++++++++++

A structured series of competitions within a sport that may be held over
a period of time, for example, Rugby World Cup, UEFA Champions League,
American Football Conference.

For the purposes of this example, we will discuss the properties of
Sports Event

[[sports-event-wrapper-in-more-detail]]
Sports Event wrapper in more detail
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sports Event MUST contain either a <player> OR a <team> child element.
It SHOULD also contain an <event-metadata> OR <event-stats> child
element.

Trying to fit different sports, for example golf and tennis, into a
common structure would be impractical, if not impossible, without
imposing severe limitations on the comprehensiveness of coverage. Using
a plug-in model, SportsML-G2 can be extended to cover actions for
virtually any sport.

Sports currently catered for are: American football, baseball,
basketball, curling, golf, ice hockey, association football (aka
soccer), motor racing, rugby football, tennis and volleyball.

[[event-metadata-event-metadata]]
Event Metadata <event-metadata>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The contents of <event-metadata> are sports-specific: for example, for
rugby, the time added to the match by the officials may be indicated.

Additionally, there are properties for recording the Event Sponsor and
details of the Event Venue, The following information might apply to the
Australian Open menâ€™s tennis final:

<event-metadata key="vendkey:l.atp.com-2009-e.19358"

event-status="speventstatus:mid-event"

start-date-time="2016-01-28T19:05:00+11:00">

<event-sponsor

type="main"

name="Kia__ __Motors">

</event-sponsor>

<site>

<site-metadata capacity="15,000" surface="vendst:Plexicushion"

home-page-url="www.australianopen.com" key="site:aus209">

<name>Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne Park</name>

</site-metadata>

<site-stats attendance="13,879" temperature="38"

temperature-units="Centigrade" />

</site>

</event-metadata>

There is a choice of many attributes of <event-metadata> to record
detailed information about an event, its timing, the venue and predicted
weather â€“ even its suitability for record-breaking on the day.

[[event-statistics-event-stats]]
Event Statistics <event-stats>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Currently has a child element of <event-stats-motor-racing> which has
attributes that enable the property to record summary events for a
complete motor race such as laps covered, caution flags, margin of
victory. For other sports, these statistics are carried at the <team>
and <player> level.

[[team-team]]
Team <team>
+++++++++++

Contains information about a team, its players, management, home
location, and performance statistics. For example, a typical (not
comprehensive <team> component:

<team id="l.mlb.com-t.16">

<team-metadata key="vendteam:l.mlb.com-t.16" alignment="home">

<name role="nrol:full">Philadelphia Phillies</name>

<name part="nprt:common">Philadelphia </name>

<name part="nprt:nickname">Phillies</name>

</team-metadata>

<player id="l.mlb.com-p.20339">

<player-metadata position-event="spbblposition:1"
key="vendperson:l.mlb.com-p.20339">

<name role="nrol:full">Freddy Garcia</name>

<name part="nprt:given">Freddy</name>

<name part="nprt:family">Garcia</name>

</player-metadata>

<player-stats>

<player-stats-baseball>

<stats-baseball-pitching earned-runs="4.81" wins="1"
losses="3"

winning-percentage=".250"/>

</player-stats-baseball>

</player-stats>

</player>

</team>

[[player-player]]
Player <player>
+++++++++++++++

Contains information about sports competitors, their membership of
teams, personal information and statistics. The example below shows how
a player component might be used to record performance statistics in a
rugby match:

<player id="l.irb.org.worldcup-p.51">

<player-metadata key="vendperson:l.irb.org.worldcup-p.51"
position-event="spbblposition:right-wing"

uniform-number="14" status="starter">

<name role="nrol:full">__Vincent__ _Clerc_ </name>

</player-metadata>

<player-stats score="0">

<player-stats-rugby>

<stats-rugby-offensive tries-scored="0" conversion-attempts="0"

conversions-scored="0"

penalty-goal-attempts="0" penalty-goals-scored="0"
drop-goals-scored="0"

handling-errors="0" kicks-total="9" kicks-into-touch="5"
runs="10"

metres-gained="10"/>

<stats-rugby-defensive tackles="10" tackles-missed="4"/>

<stats-rugby-foul cautions-total="0" ejections-total="0"/>

</player-stats-rugby>

</player-stats>

</player>

[[award-award]]
Award <award>
+++++++++++++

A medal, cup, placing or other type of award, which can be assigned to
an event, a team or a player using a local idref. .

<player id="P1">

<player-metadata

key="vendperson:us.olympics.swim.123">

<name role="nrol:full" >__Michael__ _Phelps_ </name>

</player-metadata>

</player>

<award award-type="spawtype:medal" name="Gold__ _Medal"_

player-or-team-idref="P1" />

[[event-actions-event-actions]]
Event Actions <event-actions>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

From version 3 all actions are generic. Here is a possible action
structure for a point in a tennis match:

<player id="P1">

<player-metadata key="vendperson:atp001">

<name role="nrol:full">__Roger__ __Federer__</name>

</player-metadata>

</player>

<player id="P2">

<player-metadata key="vendperson:atp:002">

<name role="nrol:full">__Rafal__ __Nadal__</name>

</player-metadata>

</player>

<actions>

<action set="3" game="10">

<action shot-type="sptenshot:volley"

receiver-score="sptengameresult:30"

serve-number="vendtenserve:first"

server-score="sptengameresult:game">

<participant idref="P1" role="vendtenrole:server"/>

<participant idref="P2" role="vendtenrole:receiver"/>

<participant idref="P1" role="vendtenrole:ball-winner"/>

</action>

</action>

</actions>

[[highlight-highlight]]
Highlight <highlight>
+++++++++++++++++++++

A textual highlight for the event. An example of its use would be to
provide a commentary-style text report on the progress of a match that
could be used in a dynamic online application:

<highlight id="h.718300" class="PRE_KICK-OFF">

Liverpool make three changes from the side that drew with Wigan. Out go
Babel, Lucas and

Benayoun. In come Riera, Kuyt and Alonso. Robbie Keane meanwhile isn't
even in the squad

amid rumours that he is set to re-join Spurs.

<sports-property formal-name="minutes-elapsed" value="0" />

</highlight>

<highlight id="h.718351" class="KICK_OFF">

We are underway here at a chilly Anfield.

<sports-property formal-name="minutes-elapsed" value="0" />

</highlight>

<highlight id="h.718358" class="COMMENT">

Good counter attack from Liverpool as Fabio Aurelio overlaps down the
left and plays it

into Steven Gerrard, but Frank Lampard does well to track back and
tackle his England team-

mate.

<sports-property formal-name="minutes-elapsed" value="2" />

</highlight>

....

<highlight id="h.718402" class="YELLOW_CARD">

Javier Mascherano is booked for a clumsy tackle on John Obi Mikel.

<sports-property formal-name="minutes-elapsed" value="21" />

</highlight>

....

<highlight id="h.718579" class="GOAL">

LIVERPOOL 1-0 CHELSEA. Fabio Aurelio crosses from the left-hand side and
TORRES dives in to

head home and score a vital goal for Liverpool.

<sports-property formal-name="minutes-elapsed" value="89" />

</highlight>

Note the use of @class to refine the semantic of each highlight
property. The highlight element can hold any content.

[[officials-officials]]
Officials <officials>
+++++++++++++++++++++

A container for one or more officials taking part in the event. The
child elements <official-metadata> and <official-stats> hold information
about the official, including rating information. For example:

<officials>

<official>

<official-metadata key="vendperson:fifa02345"

Position-event="vendoffpos:referee">

<name role="nrol:full">Keith Burkinshaw</name>

</official-metadata>

<official-stats>

<rating rating-issuer="FIFA" rating-maximum="8"

rating-value="8" />

</official-stats>

</official>

</officials>

[[wagering-statistics-wagering-stats]]
Wagering Statistics <wagering-stats>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The betting on an event uses the <wagering-stats> component, which has
possible child properties for expressing moneyline, odds, runline,
straight spread and total score. The following example shows that the UK
bookmaker William Hill is offering odds on an event of 10-1 from 8-1,
together with a timestamp.

<wagering-stats comment="Multiple wagering-odds can be given">

<wagering-odds bookmaker-key="book:uk23456"

bookmaker-name="William Hill"

date-time="20090202T15:00:00Z"

numerator="10"

denominator="1"

numerator-opening="8"

denominator-opening="1">

</wagering-odds>

</wagering-stats>

<p>(Sports Network) - A pair of teams coming off big weekend sweeps

will square off tonight at Citizens Bank Park, where the Philadelphia

Phillies welcome the Arizona Diamondbacks for the start of a three-game

series.</p>

<p>The Phillies picked up some momentum with a three-game sweep of the

Atlanta Braves, while the Diamondbacks captured all four of their games

against the Houston Astros.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Livan Hernandez threw his first complete game in almost

two years to lead the Diamondbacks to an 8-4 win over the Astros to

complete the sweep.</p>

<p>Arizona sends Doug Davis to the hill tonight, and the lefty is 0-4

over his last five starts. That includes losses in each of his last

three outings.</p>

<p>The Phillies, meanwhile, notched their first sweep of the year that

culminated with Sunday's 13-6 pounding of the Braves. Ryan Howard

flashed some of the power that won him the NL MVP last season, jacking

a pair of two-run homers in the win.</p>

<p>Right-hander Freddy Garcia takes the hill for the Phillies and is 1-

3 with a 4.81 earned run average on the year. Since winning his first

game in a Philadelphia uniform back on April 22, Garcia has gone 0-2

over his last six starts.</p>

[[referencing-the-packaged-items]]
Referencing the packaged items
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Each of the documents listed has a <filename> property in <itemMeta>
that gives the recommended name that should be used when storing the
document in the receiverâ€™s system. The data fileâ€™s property is:

<fileName>xt.5932656-pitcher-preview.xml</fileName>

The property for the text document is:

<fileName>xt.5932656-preview.xml</fileName>

These filenames will be referenced by the NewsML-G2 Package Item.

[[item-metadata-and-content-metadata]]
Item Metadata and Content Metadata
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The <itemMeta> contains Management Metadata about the Item as a whole,
and some Content Metadata (located, creator, and subject) that is common
to both items is repeated in the <contentMeta> of the package as an aid
to processing by the receiver.

[[the-group-set-groupset-component]]
The Group Set <groupSet> component
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

These processing Hint Properties are also a feature of the item
references in the package payload component <groupSet>. Some of the
metadata from the referenced items is inherited by the <itemRef>
property for each member of the package. This enables the receiver to
carry out some processing of the package without needing to retrieve the
referenced items, for example to display on a web summary page.

In order to achieve this, each item reference contains a @contenttype to
alert the receiver to the format of the content being referenced, plus
the genre of the content, together with headline and summary.

This is a simple package of two related items, so no package hierarchy
is needed. The package <groupSet> structure and its relationship to the
information assets that it references may be illustrated in diagram form
as shown below

[[_Ref221595581]][[_Toc470002538]]Figure 19: Diagram of Package Group
structure

This produces a <groupSet> component in XML as follows:

<groupSet root="G1">

<group id="G1" role="group:main">
