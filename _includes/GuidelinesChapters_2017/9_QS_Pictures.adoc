Quick Start: Pictures and Graphics
----------------------------------

[[introduction-4]]
Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Image content, including pictures and graphics, can be conveyed in a
standard NewsML-G2 document. Picture providers and consumers need a rich
vocabulary for descriptive and technical metadata, and for
administrative metadata such as rights and usage terms. There is also a
long-established use of embedded metadata, such as the IPTC/IIM Fields
in JPEG and TIFF files. This Quick Start guide addresses some aspects of
embedded metadata, but for a full description of the mapping embedded
metadata and IIM fields to NewsML-G2, this is described in detail in
Mapping Embedded Photo Metadata to NewsML-G2.

The example in this Quick Start guide is a simple but complete document
that shows how to implement in NewsML-G2 the frequently-used needs of a
professional picture workflow:

* Right and usage instructions
* Descriptive and administrative properties such as Location and
Categorisation
* Separate technical renditions of a picture

TIP: We recommend reading the Quick Start Guide to NewsML-G2 Basics +
before this Quick Start Guide.

The picture and the metadata used in the example are courtesy of Getty
Images. _Note that the sample code is NOT intended to be a guide to
receiving NewsML-G2 from Getty Images._

About the example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

image:GYI0062134533.jpg[image,width=200,height=132]

A library picture is provided to customers in three sizes: a large image intended for high
resolution and/or large size display, a medium-sized image intended for
web use, and a small image for use as a thumbnail or icon. These are
three _alternative_ renditions of the same picture and can be contained
in a single NewsML-G2 document.

(All Scheme Aliases used in the listing below indicate IPTC NewsCodes
vocabularies, except for the following alias values: _crol, crel, gyibt,

Each wrapper element is highlighted using a different background colour
to aid identification. A logical diagram of this structure is shown in
the Quick Start Guide to NewsML-G2 Basics.

[[document-structure-1]]
Document structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The building blocks of the NewsML-G2 document are the <newsItem> root
element, with additional wrapping elements for metadata about the News
Item (itemMeta), metadata about the content (contentMeta) and the
content itself (contentSet).

The root <newsItem> attributes are:

[source, xml]
<newsItem xmlns="http://iptc.org/std/nar/2006-10-01/__
	guid="tag:gettyimages.com.2010:GYI0062134533"
	version="8"
	standard="NewsML-G2"
	standardversion="2.23"
	conformance="power"
	xml:lang="en-US">

Note that this example uses a Tag URI (see http://taguri.org/[TAG URI
home page] for details)

This is followed by references to the Catalogs used to resolve QCodes in
the Item, and Rights information:

</rightsInfo>

[[source]]
Source
^^^^^^

Note that the IIM "Source" field maps to the NewsML-G2 <copyrightHolder>
element of the <rightsInfo> block.

[[item-metadata-itemmeta-2]]
Item Metadata <itemMeta>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[source, xml]
<itemMeta>
	<itemClass qcode="ninat:picture">
	<provider qcode="nprov:GYI">
		<name>Getty Images Inc.</name>
	</provider>
	<versionCreated>2016-11-12T06:42:04Z</versionCreated>
	<firstCreated>2010-10-20T20:58:00Z</firstCreated>
</itemMeta>

The <itemClass> property uses a QCode from the IPTC News Item Nature
NewsCodes to denote that the Item conveys a picture.

The Z suffix denotes UTC. Note the <firstCreated> property refers to the
creation of the Item, NOT the content.

[[embedded-metadata]]
Embedded metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For many years IPTC metadata fields have been embedded in JPEG or TIFF
images files. From 1995 on the IPTC Information Interchange Model (IIM)
defined the semantics of the fields and the technical format for saving
them in image files. In 2003 Adobe introduced a new format for saving
metadata, namely XMP (Extended Metadata Platform), and many IPTC IIM
fields were specified as the "IPTC Core" metadata schema. This defined
identical semantics but opened the formats for saving to IIM and XMP in
parallel. Later the "IPTC Extension" metadata schema was added; the
defined fields are stored by XMP only. Thus, many people work with IPTC
photo metadata, regardless how they are saved in the files; this is
handled by the software they use.

The transfer of IPTC Photo Metadata fields to NewsML-G2 properties has a
focus on the equivalence of the semantics of fields. The retrieval of
the embedded values from the files is a secondary issue and documents
like the Guidelines for Handling Image Metadata, produced by the
Metadata Working Group (http://www.metadataworkinggroup.org/specs/) help
in this area.

This Quick Start guide will provide the basics of this mapping, for more
details see Mapping Embedded Photo Metadata to NewsML-G2. You can also
learn more from the IPTC web by visiting https://www.iptc.org/standards/
and following the link to Photo Metadata.

The screen shot on the following page shows the panel for the IPTC Core
fields as displayed by Adobe’s Photoshop CS File Info screen; note the
IPTC Extension tab that displays the additional IPTC Extension metadata.

image:file-info-css.png[Getty-fileinfo copy.png,width=318,height=289]

[[_Toc403107363]][[_Toc470002523]]Figure 4: IPTC Core Metadata fields in
the File Info panel of Adobe Photoshop

There are advantages, in a professional workflow, to carrying metadata
independently of the binary asset:

* There is no need to retrieve and open the file to read essential
information about the picture
* An editor may not have access to the original picture to modify its
metadata
* A library picture used to illustrate a news event may have
inappropriate embedded metadata.

A situation may arise where the metadata expressed in the NewsML-G2 Item
and the embedded metadata in the photo are different. Some providers
choose to strip all embedded metadata from objects, to avoid potential
confusion. If not, a provider should specify any processing rules in its
terms of use.

The IPTC recommends that _descriptive_ metadata properties that exist in
the NewsML-G2 Item (in Content Metadata) ALWAYS take precedence over the
equivalent embedded metadata (if it exists). These properties include
genre, subject, headline, description and creditline.

[[content-metadata-contentmeta-2]]
Content Metadata <contentMeta>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how embedded metadata from the example picture are
translated into NewsML-G2, and includes the equivalent IPTC Core
metadata schema property highlighted thus:

IPTC Core Schema equivalent:

[[administrative-metadata-2]]
Administrative metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[timestamp]]
Timestamp
+++++++++

The <contentCreated> element is used to give the creation date of the
picture:

[source, xml]
<contentCreated>2010-10-20T19:45:58-04:00</contentCreated>

Note that this value refers to the creation of the original content; for
a scanned picture this is always the date (and optionally the time) of
the original photograph. The property type is Truncated Date Time, so
that when the precise date-time is unknown, for example for an historic
photograph, the value can be truncated (from the right) to a simple date
or just a year.

IPTC Core Schema equivalent: Date Created

[[creator-1]]
Creator
+++++++

The example uses a <creator> element without an identifier, but includes
an optional @role that contains a QCode qualifying the creator as a
photographer:

[source, xml]
<creator role="crol:photographer">
	<name>Spencer Platt</name>
	<related rel="crel:isA" qcode="gyibt:staff" />
</creator>

The <related> child element of <creator> further qualifies the
photographer as a member of staff (as distinct from, say, a freelance
photographer)

IPTC Core Schema equivalent: Creator

[[contributor]]
Contributor
+++++++++++

A <contributor> identifies people or organisations who did not originate
the content, but have added value to it. In this case, the @role value
is a hint that the contributor added descriptive metadata:

[source, xml]
<contributor role="ctrol:descrWriter">
	<name>sp/lrc</name>
</contributor>

IPTC Core Schema equivalent: Description Writer

[[creditline]]
Creditline
++++++++++

The <creditline> is a natural-language string that must be used by the
receiver to indicate the credit(s) for the content, as directed in the
business terms agreed with the provider or copyright holder:

[source, xml]
<creditline>Getty Images</creditline>

IPTC Core Schema equivalent: Credit Line

[[descriptive-metadata-2]]
Descriptive metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[subject-1]]
Subject
+++++++

As described in the Quick Start Guide to NewsML-G2 Basics, the subject
matter of content is expressed using the <subject> element. The optional
@type uses the IPTC Concept Nature NewsCodes (recommended scheme alias
"cpnat") to indicate the type of concept being expressed. The following
example uses a value of "cpnat:event" to indicate that the concept is an
Event, and the QCode identifies the Event in the scheme with an alias
"gyimeid":

[source, xml]
<subject type="cpnat:event" qcode="gyimeid:104530187" />

The provider can use this Event ID to "tag" each of the pictures that
relate to this topic, enabling receivers to group them via the Event ID.

The picture of Las Vegas Boulevard illustrates a story about
unemployment. This example uses codes and associated <name> child
elements from the IPTC Media Topic NewsCodes:

[source, xml]
<subject type="cpnat:abstract" qcode="medtop:20000523">
	<name xml:lang="en-GB">labour market</name>
	<name xml:lang="de">Arbeitsmarkt</name>
</subject>
<subject type="cpnat:abstract" qcode="medtop:20000533">
	<name xml:lang="en-GB">unemployment</name>
	<name xml:lang="de">Arbeitslosigkeit</name>
</subject>

[[city-stateprovince-country]]
City, State/Province, Country
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The <located> element in the <contentMeta> block describes the place
where the picture was created. This may be the same location as the
event portrayed in the picture, but this cannot be assumed. The location
of the event is logically part of the subject matter – the City,
State/Province, Country fields in the IPTC Photo Metadata are defined as
"the location shown" – so should use the <subject> element. To
summarise:

* Use <located> to describe where the camera was located when taking the
picture.
* Use <subject> to describe the location shown in the picture. It is
recommended that @type is used to indicate the property identifies a
geographical area.

The location shown in the example picture is Las Vegas Boulevard. Child
elements of <subject> may be used to add further details, including:

* <name> gives the place name in plain text, and
* <broader>footnote:[<broader> is only available at Power Conformance
Level, which is why we set @conformance to "power" in <newsItem>]
expresses the concept of Las Vegas Boulevard as part of the broader
entity of Las Vegas which in turn is part of broader entities of Nevada
state and of the United States.

It is recommended that the nature of the concept is indicated by @type
using a value from the IPTC Concept Nature NewsCodes, in this case that
the concept identifies a geographical area:

The completed <subject> structure for the geographical information is:

[source, xml]
<subject type="cpnat:geoArea">
	<name>Las Vegas Boulevard</name>
</subject>
<subject type="cpnat:geoArea" qcode="gycon:89109">
	<name>Las Vegas</name>
	<broader qcode="iso3166-1a2:US-NV">
	<name>Nevada</name>
	</broader>
	<broader qcode="iso3166-1a3:USA">
	<name>United States</name>
	</broader>
</subject>

[[keywords]]
Keywords
++++++++

QCodes and relationship properties are powerful tools, but keywords are
still widely used by picture archives. The NewsML-G2 <keyword> property
is mapped from the "Keywords" field in XMP. The semantics of "keyword"
can vary from provider to provider, but should not present problems in
the news industry, which is familiar enough with their use:

[source, xml]
<keyword>business</keyword>
<keyword>economic</keyword>
<keyword>economy</keyword>
<keyword>finance</keyword>
<keyword>poor</keyword>
<keyword>poverty</keyword>
<keyword>gamble</keyword>

IPTC Core Schema equivalent: Keywords

[[headline-description]]
Headline, Description
+++++++++++++++++++++

These two IPTC/IIM fields map directly to elements of the same name in
NewsML-G2. Both <headline> and <description> also have an optional
@role. The IPTC maintains a set of NewsCodes for Description Role
(recommended scheme alias "drol"). In this case, as the description is
of a photograph, the role will be "caption". Description is a _Block_
type element, meaning it may contain line breaks.

Both elements have optional attributes which may be used to support
international use: @xml:lang, @dir (text direction):

[source, xml]
<headline>Variety Of Recessionary Forces Leave Las Vegas

<description role="drol:caption">A general view of part of downtown,

hit with unemployment currently at 14.7 percent and the highest

[[picture-data]]
Picture data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Binary content is conveyed within the NewsML-G2 <contentSet> wrapper by
one or more <remoteContent> elements, enabling multiple alternate
renditions of a picture within the same Item.

[[remote-content]]
Remote Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The <remoteContent> element references objects that exist independently
of the current NewsML-G2 Item. In the example there is an instance of
<remote Content> for each of the three separate binary renditions of the
picture.

[[_Toc403107364]][[_Toc470002524]]Figure 5: Each <remoteContent> wrapper
references a separate rendition of the binary resource

Each remote content instance contains attributes that conceptually can
be split into three groups:

* *Target resource attributes* enable the receiver to accurately
identify the remote resource, it’s content type and size;
* *Content attributes* enable the processor to distinguish the different
business purposes of the content using @rendition;
* *Content Characteristics* contain technical metadata such as
dimensions, colour values and resolution.

Frequently used attributes from these groups are described below, but
note that the NewsML-G2 XML structure that delimits the groups may not
be visible in all XML editors. For details of these attribute groups,
see the NewsML-G2 Specification, which can be downloaded from
http://www.newsml-g2.org/spec[www.newsml-g2.org/spec].

[[target-resource-attributes]]
 Target Resource Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This group of attributes express administrative metadata, such as
identification and versioning, for the referenced content, which could
be a file on a mounted file system, a Web resource, or an object within
a CMS. NewsML-G2 flexibly supports alternative methods of identifying
and locating the externally-stored content. For this example, the
picture renditions are located in the same folder as the NewsML-G2
document.

The two attributes of <remoteContent> available to identify and locate
the content are Hyperlink (@href) and Resource Identifier Reference
(@residref). Either one MUST be used to identify and locate the target
resource. They MAY optionally be used together, Their intended use is:

* @href _locates_ any resource, using an IRI.
* @residref _identifies_ a _managed_ resource, using an identifier that
may be globally unique.

[[hyperlink-href]]
Hyperlink (@href)
+++++++++++++++++

An IRI, for example:

[source, xml]
<remoteContent href="
http://example.com/2008-12-20/pictures/foo.jpg"

Or (amongst other possibilities):

[source, xml]
<remoteContent href="file:///./GYI0062134533-web.jpg"

[[resource-identifier-reference-residref]]
Resource Identifier Reference (@residref)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An XML Schema string, such as:

[source, xml]
<remoteContent residref="tag:example.com,2008:PIX:FOO20081220098658"

It is up to the provider to specify how @residref may be resolved to
retrieve the actual content.

[[version-1]]
Version
++++++++

An XML Schema positive integer denoting the version of the target
resource. In the absence of this attribute, recipients should assume
that the target is the latest available version:

[source, xml]
<remoteContent href="file:///./__ _GYI0062134533-web.jpg"
	version="1"

[[content-type]]
Content Type
++++++++++++

The Media Type of the target resource:

[source, xml]
contenttype="image/jpeg"

[[size]]
Size
++++

Indicates the size of the target resource in bytes.

[source, xml]
size="346071"

[[news-content-attributes]]
News Content Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This group of attributes of <remoteContent> enables a processor or
human-reader to distinguish between different components; in this case
the alternative resolutions of the picture. The principal attribute of
this group is @rendition, described below.

[[rendition]]
Rendition
+++++++++

The rendition attribute MUST use a QCode, either proprietary or using
the IPTC NewsCodes for rendition, which has a Scheme URI of
http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/rendition/ and recommended Scheme Alias of
"rnd" and contains (amongst others) the values that we need: highRes,
web, thumbnail. Thus using the appropriate NewsCode, the high resolution
rendition of the picture may be identified as:

[source, xml]
<remoteContent rendition="rnd:highRes"

To avoid processing ambiguity, each specific rendition value should be
used only once per News Item, except when the same rendition is
available from multiple remote locations. In this case, the same value
of rendition may be given to several Remote Content elements.

[[news-content-characteristics]]
News Content Characteristics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This group of attributes describes the physical properties of the
referenced object specific its media type. Text, for example, may use
@wordcount). Audio and video are provided with attributes appropriate to
streamed media, such as @audiobitrate, @videoframerate. The appropriate
attributes for pictures are described below.

[[picture-width-and-picture-height]]
Picture Width and Picture Height
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The dimension attributes @width and @height are optionally qualified by
@dimensionunit, which specifies the units being used. This is a @qcode
value and it is recommended that the value is taken from the IPTC
Dimension Unit NewsCodes, whose URI is
http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/dimensionunit/ (recommended Scheme Alias is
"dimensionunit")

If @dimensionunit is absent, the default units for each content type
are:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=========================================
|Content Type a|
Height Unit

(default)

 a|
Width Unit

(default)

|Picture |pixels |pixels
|Graphic: Still / Animated |points |points
|Video (Analog) |lines |pixels
|Video (Digital) |pixels |pixels
|=========================================

As the dimensions of the example picture are expressed in pixels,
@dimensionunit is not needed:

[source, xml]
width="480"
height="2075"

[[picture-orientation]]
Picture Orientation

This indicates that the image requires an orientation change before it
can be properly viewed, using values of 1 to 8 (inclusive), where 1 (the
default) is "upright": that is the visual top of the picture is at the
top, and the visual left side of the picture in on the left.

The application of these orientation values is described in detail in
the _News Content Characteristics_ section of the NewsML-G2
Specification. (This can be downloaded by visiting
https://iptc.org/standards/ and following the link to NewsML-G2.)

The example picture above has an orientation value of 1:

[source, xml]
width="1500" __
height="1001"
orientation="1"

[[layout-orientation]]
Layout Orientation
+++++++++++++++++++

It is possible to calculate the best way to use a picture in a page
layout using the combined technical characteristics of Height, Width and
Orientation, but many implementers are reluctant to rely on technical
characteristics to make editorial judgements (determining whether a
video is SD or HD is another example). The @layoutorientation is a way
to express editorial advice on the best way to use a picture in a
layout. The value for the example picture is:

[source, xml]
layoutorientation="loutorient:horizontal"

Values in the Layout Orientation Scheme are:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Code |Definition
|horizontal |The human interpretation of the top of the image is aligned
to the long side.

|vertical |The human interpretation of the top of the image is aligned
to the short side.

|Square |Both sides of the image are about identical, there is no short
and long side.

|unaligned |There is no human interpretation of the top of the image.
|=======================================================================

[[picture-colour-space]]
Picture Colour Space
++++++++++++++++++++

The colour space of the target resource, and MUST use a QCode. The
recommended scheme is the IPTC Colour Space NewsCodes (recommended
scheme alias "colsp") Note the UK English spelling of colour.

[source, xml]
colourspace="colsp:AdobeRGB"

[[colour-depth]]
Colour Depth
++++++++++++

The optional @colourdepth indicates using a non-negative integer the
number of bits used to define the colour of each pixel in a still image,
graphic or video.

[source, xml]
colourdepth="24"

[[content-hints]]
Content Hints
+++++++++++++

At the Power conformance level, the provider is able to express metadata
from the target resource as an aid to processing.footnoteref:[altid,It is not mandatory for the metadata to be extracted from the target resource, but it MUST agree with any
existing metadata within the target resource.]
In this case, the provider has added an <altId> – an alternative
identifier – for the resource.

Alternative identifiers may be needed by customer systems. The <altId>
element may optionally be refined using a QCode to describe the context
– in this case a "master ID" that is proprietary to the provider. This
makes clear the purpose of the alternative identifier. Also note that
Alternative Identifiers are useful only to another application; and not
intended to be used by THIS NewsML-G2 processor. The provider MUST tell
receivers how to interpret alternative identifiers, otherwise they are
meaningless.

[source, xml]
<altId type="gyiid:masterID">105864332</altId>

Note that in this example only the high resolution rendition has an
<altId>.

[[signal-1]]
Signal
+++++++

The signal property instructs the NewsML-G2 processor to process an Item
or its content in a specific way. As a child element of itemMeta, the
scope of <signal> is the whole of the document and/or its contents. If
alternative renditions of content have specific processing needs, use
<signal> as a child element of <remoteContent> to specify the processing
instructions.

[[completed-remotecontent-wrapper]]
Completed <remoteContent> wrapper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The <remoteContent> wrapping element in full for the "High Res" picture
in the example:

[source, xml]
<remoteContent rendition="rnd:highRes" __
	href="./GYI0062134533.jpg" version="1"
	size="346071" contenttype="image/jpeg" width="1500"
	height="1001" colourspace="colsp:AdobeRGB" orientation="1"
	layoutorientation="loutorient:horizontal">
	<altId type="gyiid:masterID">105864332</altId>
</remoteContent>
