Mapping Embedded Photo Metadata to NewsML-G2
---------------------------------------------

[[introduction-16]]
Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Embedded metadata in JPEG and other file formats have been a _de facto_
standard since the 1990s. In fact, the metadata schema adopted by Adobe
Systems Inc for the original "File Info" dialog box in Photoshop is
based on the IPTC Information Interchange Model (IIM). This standard for
exchanging all types of news assets and metadata pre-dates XML-based
standards such as NewsML-G2. The IIM-based embedded properties in images
became known as the "IPTC Fields" or "IPTC Header" and they were widely
adopted in professional workflows.

In about 2001, in order to overcome some technical limitations imposed
by this legacy model, Adobe introduced the Extensible Metadata Platform,
or XMPfootnote:[Although developed by Adobe, XMP is an open technology
like its IIM-based predecessor, and has been adopted by other software
vendors and manufacturers. Adobe and others, including Microsoft, Apple
and Canon, have formed the Metadata Working Group, a consortium that
promotes preservation and inter-operability of digital image metadata.
The MWG web site is
http://www.metadataworkinggroup.org[www.metadataworkinggroup.org].], to
its suite of applications that includes Photoshop. Adobe also worked
with the IPTC to migrate the properties of the legacy "IPTC Header" to
XMP. Most of the original IIM-based metadata properties are contained in
the IPTC Core Schema for XMP. Further IPTC properties that are derived
from NewsML-G2 properties are available in the IPTC Extension Schema for
XMP.

However, when IIM-based properties were added to software packages such
as Photoshop, the original semantic definitions of IIM were left behind,
and in the absence of formal definitions, the use of these properties
among vendors and agencies began to diverge as semantics of the labels
were interpreted differently. The IPTC addressed this in 2005 by
bringing interested parties together to agree the IPTC Photo Metadata
Standard, based on recognised current industry practice. The latest
version (as of this edition of the Guidelines) was approved in 2016.
(For more information on the Standard visit the IPTC website
https://iptc.org[iptc.org] and navigate to Photo Metadata.)

A mapping of IIM legacy properties IPTC Core Schema NewsML-G2 is given
below in 22.8, but this can only be regarded as "the basics". A full
mapping of the IPTC Photo Metadata Standard backwards to IIM (where
feasible) and forwards to NewsML-G2 may be found in the document
https://www.iptc.org/std/photometadata/specification/mapping/iptc-pmd-newsmlg2.html[iptc-pmd-newsmlg2]
on the IPTC website. Note that because the photo metadata world has
moved on since the original IIM specification, the semantic
interpretation of IIM in the mapping guide follows the Photo Metadata
Standard, which is in some cases slightly different to the IIM 4.2
Specification.

[[iptc-metadata-for-xmp]]
IPTC Metadata for XMP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the IPTC Photo Metadata in Adobe CS3 and CS4 a set of custom
panels for Bridge must be downloaded from the IPTC web site and
installed on your Windows or Mac OS X computer. Adobe CS5 and higher
provides built-in File Info panels covering both IPTC Core and
Extension. Be aware that these custom panels only work up to version CS
5.5 of Bridge. To download visit http://www.iptc.org[www.iptc.org] and
navigate to Photo Metadata.

The IPTC web site also lists image manipulation software packages that
synchronize the legacy IIM-based header fields and XMP properties. The
IPTC Custom Panels User Guide tabulates the field labels used by IIM,
IPTC Core, and the equivalent fields of software packages such as
Photoshop, iViewMedia, Thumbs, and Irfanview.

[[synchronizing-xmp-and-legacy-metadata]]
Synchronizing XMP and legacy metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When opening an image that contains the legacy IIM-based IPTC metadata,
using an application that supports XMP, users may need to be aware of
synchronization issues. Digital images that pre-date XMP contain the
legacy IIM-based metadata in a special area of the JPEG, TIFF or PSD
file called the Image Resource Block (IRB). XMP-aware applications store
metadata in the file differently, in the XMP Packet.

Current versions of Adobe’s software such as Photoshop write the
metadata to the IIM-header wrapped by the IRB, and to the XMP packet,
when saving a file. Therefore, an image which contained only legacy
metadata when opened could have metadata written to a new XMP packet
(where an IIMXMP mapping exists) when saved.

If a picture with XMP metadata is modified by a non-compliant
application (i.e. the IRB only is changed), this should be detected by
the next XMP-compliant processor that opens the picture, using a
checksum. The Metadata Working Group guidance document has a detailed
chapter on these synchronization issues.

There is no guarantee that the synchronization of legacy and XMP
metadata will be supported in future versions of Adobe software, or
applications from other vendors.

opened in Adobe Photoshop.

[[picture-services-using-iimxmp]]
Picture services using IIM/XMP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many news and picture agencies deliver images to their customers using
IIM. Customers receive these services in three variants:

* As binary files such as JPEG that support embedded IIM metadata in the
file header as "IPTC Fields" and/or XMP.
* As binary files such as JPEG with additional embedded IIM fields
beyond the set adopted by Adobe that are used by proprietary
image-management software applications. These fields are not read by
off-the-shelf software packages such as Photoshop. This format is used
by the photo departments of many news agencies.
* As binary IIM files which consist of the IIM envelope and associated
object (picture) data. The conveyed picture may also contain embedded
IPTC-IIM fields, but this metadata may not be synchronized with the IIM
envelope in all instances. Providers’ synchronization practices vary.

[[rationale-for-moving-to-newsml-g2]]
Rationale for moving to NewsML-G2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is probable that providers will continue to embed metadata in image
and graphics files, but both providers and customers may derive benefits
from exchanging this content using NewsML-G2:

* metadata carried in a NewsML-G2 document is accessible without the
need to retrieve and open the associated image file;
* in some business applications, editors have to modify picture metadata
but have no access or permission to modify the metadata in the image
file, and the provider needs therefore to instruct receivers to use the
NewsML-G2 metadata;
* partners in an information exchange can standardise on a common method
for managing all kinds of news objects.
* Some news providers’ picture services are already being migrated to
NewsML-G2. Some are already using NewsML-G2 as their internal standard
for storing and exchanging all types of news objects; it makes sense to
migrate to a common standard for customer-facing applications too.
* IIM is a legacy format and has some inherent issues, such as limits on
field lengths and difficulty with internationalization.

The IPTC web site has an IIM Home page. Visit
https://iptc.org/standards/[www.iptc.org/standards] and follow the link
to IIM to view the Specification and other documents. These include a
list of software packages that support IIM metadata fields, and a link
to a document that maps IIM fields IPTC Core (XMP) Software Package
labels, maintained by David Riecks at
http://www.controlledvocabulary.com[www.controlledvocabulary.com].

More about the use of IIM for photos can be found in the "Photo
Metadata" section of the IPTC website.

[[approach]]
Approach
~~~~~~~~

Although IIM can handle any type of media object, its use for media
types other than pictures is now rare, so this section will focus on the
issue of migrating IIM picture metadata, chiefly those found in Adobe’s
Photoshop "IPTC Header", to NewsML-G2 properties. It is NOT intended to
describe a mapping of the complete IIM envelope or IPTC Photo Metadata
Standard to NewsML-G2. (See 22.1 for a reference to this resource.)

[[iim-to-newsml-g2-field-mapping-reference]]
IIM to NewsML-G2 Field Mapping Reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IIM is organised into Records and DataSets. The DataSets that are
embedded in image files are in the Application Record (Record Two). Each
IIM DataSet is labelled according to the parent Record and its position
within the Record (these numbers are not necessarily contiguous). The
IIM Specification contains details of the record structure. (Location
details above in paragraph 22.6)

The table below shows IIM DataSets that have been (with noted
exceptions) adopted for the IPTC Photo Metadata. Each DataSet is shown
with its IIM name, equivalent IPTC Photo Metadata Name (if available),
and the corresponding NewsML-G2 Property.

[[object-name-title]]
Object Name / Title
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The <title> element is a child of <itemMeta> and is intended to be a
human-readable identifier. The <itemMeta> block also contains some
mandatory NewsML-G2 elements, as shown:

<itemMeta>

<itemClass qcode="ninat:picture" />

<provider qcode="nprov:AcmeNews" />

<versionCreated>2016-10-19T02:20:00Z</versionCreated>

<pubStatus qcode="stat:usable" />

<fileName>USA-CRASH-MILITARY_001_HI.jpg</fileName>

<title>USA-CRASH/MILITARY</title>

<edNote />

</itemMeta>

Some providers may additionally map this DataSet to the NewsML-G2
<slugline> property in <contentMeta>:

<slugline>USA-CRASH/MILITARY</slugline>

[[urgency]]
Urgency
^^^^^^^

The DataSet Urgency has been deprecated in the latest version of the
IIM, and in the IPTC Photo Metadata Standard. It may still be used in
some services, and therefore if present may be mapped to the
corresponding NewsML-G2 property, which is a child of <contentMeta>:

<urgency>4</urgency>

[[keywords-1]]
Keywords
^^^^^^^^

The semantics of keyword are somewhat open: some providers use keywords
to denote "key" words that can be used by text-based search engines;
some use "keyword" to categorise the content using mnemonics, amongst
other examples. The IPTC recommends that the IIM/Photo Metadata Keywords
property is mapped to the repeatable <keyword> element in NewsML-G2 (one
<keyword> element per keyword)

If this mapping cannot be assumed, the IPTC suggests the following rules
when configuring a mapping of Keywords metadata:

* Assess if any existing NewsML-G2 properties align to this use of
keyword. Typical examples are
** Genres ("Feature", "Obituary", "Portrait", etc.)
** Media types ("Photo", "Video", "Podcast" etc.)
** Products/services by which the content is distributed
* If the keyword expresses the subject of the content it MAY go into the
<subject> property with the keyword string placed in a <name> child
element of the subject with a language tag if required.
* If migrated to <subject>, providers should also consider:
* Adding @type if the nature of the concept expressed by the keyword can
be determined
* Using a QCode if there is a corresponding concept in a controlled
vocabulary
* If none of the above conditions are met, then implementers should
default to using <keyword> with a @role if possible to define the
semantic of the keywords.

The contents of the Keywords field in the example shown are intended to
be used as natural-language "key" words that could be used by a
text-based search engine to index the content. Therefore, they will be
mapped to <keyword>.

<keyword role="krole:index">us</keyword>

<keyword role="krole:index">military</keyword>

<keyword role="krole:index">aviation</keyword>

<keyword role="krole:index">crash</keyword>

<keyword role="krole:index">fire</keyword>

In IIM, the Keywords DataSet is repeatable, with each holding one
keyword; therefore each keyword is mapped to separate <keyword>
properties, even though they may appear as a comma-separated list in
software application dialogs.

[[special-instruction]]
Special Instruction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The contents of this field could go into <edNote>, a child of
<itemMeta>, which is placed after the <title> element (if present), if
the nature of the instruction is a generic message to the receiver or
its nature is unknown:

<itemMeta>

...

<edNote>NO ARCHIVAL OR WIRELESS USE</edNote>

</itemMeta>

If appropriate and advised by the provider, an alternative mapping for
the contents of this field MAY be <usageTerms>, parts of the
<rightsInfo> block:

<rightsInfo>

<copyrightHolder qcode="prov:TR">

<name>Thomson Reuters</name>

</copyrightHolder>

<copyrightNotice>Copyright 2008 Thomson Reuters.

</copyrightNotice>

<usageTerms>NO ARCHIVAL OR WIRELESS USE</usageTerms>

</rightsInfo>

[[date-created]]
Date Created
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This maps to <contentCreated>, a child of <contentMeta>, since it refers
to the content itself, for example:

<contentMeta>

<contentCreated>2008-12-08</contentCreated>

....

</contentMeta>

When there is a Time Created value present in the IIM Record, this
should be merged with Date Created, as the NewsML-G2 property accepts a
Truncated DateTime value (i.e. the value may be truncated if parts of
the Date-Time are not available).footnote:[If present, the time part
must be used in full, with time zone, and ONLY in the presence of the
full date.]

<contentMeta>

<contentCreated>2008-12-08T13:30:00-08:00</contentCreated>

....

</contentMeta>

[[by-line-credit-source]]
By-line, Credit, Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These three IIM DataSets are complementary, but each has a distinct
application:

* By-line is intended to identify the creator of the content
* Credit identifies the provider of the content
* Source holds the identity of a party having a role in the supply chain
of the content.

[[by-line]]
By-line
+++++++

The recommended mapping for By-line (IIM 2:80) is to the <creator> child
element of <contentMeta>, rather than <by>. This is because <creator> is
an administrative property that is intended to be machine-readable; the
IPTC recommends that controlled vocabularies should be used if possible.
The NewsML-G2 <by> property is a human-readable natural language
property that is intended for display, but does not unambiguously
identify the creator.

The example below shows this identification metadata in its
administrative context. Expressed in this way using QCodes, the metadata
can be used for administration and search. Using a CV, the photographer
can be uniquely and unambiguously identified. The optional <name> is
shown, and the <creator> property also allows the use of the child
element <related> which in this case is used to express the
photographer’s job title, again using a QCode, from IIM DataSet 2:85
(By-line Title)

<creator role="crol:photog" qcode="pers:JS001">

<name>John Smith</name>

<related rel="personrel:jobtitle"qcode="stafftitles:photo">

<name>Staff Photographer</name>

</related>

</creator>

[[credit]]
Credit
++++++

Credit should be mapped to the <creditline> child property of
<contentMeta>. There is a <provider> property of <itemMeta>, but the
Credit does necessarily reflect the provider. Many picture providers use
IIM Credit to display the name of the person, organisation, or both, who
should be credited when the picture is used. In this context,
<creditline> is appropriate because it is a natural-language label that
is intended to be displayed.

<creditline>Acme/John Smith</creditline>

[[source-1]]
Source
++++++

In the original IIM specification up to 4.1, Source refers to the
initial holder of the copyright. In IIM 4.2, the semantics of Source
were changed to be "_…a person or party who has a role in the content
supply chain. This could be an agency, a member of an agency, an
individual or a combination. Source could be different from Creator and
from the entities in the Copyright Notice._". This more "open"
definition reflects current usage by the broad range of users and aligns
with the Photo Metadata Standard.

In some distribution systems, the original owner of the copyright (as
distinct from the current owner) is important, and some providers use
the Source field for this information. This was the original intention
of the IIM Specification which used Source for the Original Owner, and
the Copyright Notice (DataSet 2:116) to hold the copyright statement
which includes the Current Owner.

Using the current definition of Source, the recommended mapping to
NewsML-G2 is the <infoSource> element, a child of <contentMeta> (OR if
the source is the original copyright owner +
<rightsInfo> (with @validto time delimiter) with a <copyrightHolder>
child element).

In this case, the original copyright holder is Thomson Reuters, and the
Source is Acme News. The following uses a controlled value to indicate
the @role of the party named as the Information Source:

<contentMeta>

...

<infoSource role="isrole:provider">

<name>Acme News LLC</name>

</infoSource>

...

For more on this topic, see Identifying Sources and Workflow Actors.

[[city-provincestate-and-country]]
City, Province/State and Country
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As discussed in Quick Start: Pictures and Graphics geographical metadata
in images may have different contexts:

* The location from which the content originates, i.e. where the camera
was located. NewsML-G2 has a <located> property to express this.
* The location shown in the picture – in NewsML-G2 this is a <subject>
property of the picture.

Although for the majority of pictures, these are effectively the same
spot, one can envisage situations where these two semantically distinct
locations are not in the same place: a picture of Mount Fuji taken from
downtown Tokyo is one example which is often quoted.

When mapping from IIM or IIM-based Photoshop fields, we assume that the
intention of the provider is to express the location shown in the image,
as this is the more customary use of these fields. (Be aware that
specific providers may have their own convention, and receivers are
advised to check).

The location shown in the example image may be expressed using a single
<subject> property for the location, linked to an <assert> block:

<contentMeta>

....

<subject type="cpnat:poi" literal="int001" />

....

</contentMeta>

<assert literal="int001">

<POIDetails>

<address>

<line>University City</line>

<locality qcode="mycity:int002" type="cpnatexp:geoAreaCity">

<name>San Diego</name>

</locality>

<area qcode="mystate:int003" type="cpnatexp:geoAreaProvState">

<name>California</name>

</area>

<country qcode="iso3166-1a2:US" type="cpnatexp:geoAreaCountry">

<name>

United States

</name>

</country>

</address>

</POIDetails>

</assert>

Using <assert> in this way can be an advantage if a concept is used more
than once in the NewsML-G2 Item. For example if both the Location Shown
and the Location Created are the same place, all of the required concept
details can be grouped in one <assert> and shared by both properties,
for example:

...

<located type="cpnat:poi" literal="int001" />

<!-- Camera location -->

...

<subject type="cpnat:poi" literal="int001" />

<!-- Subject of picture -->

...

<assert literal="int001">

<POIDetails>

....

[[original-transmission-reference]]
Original Transmission Reference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is defined in IIM as "a code representing the location of original
transmission", but in common usage this DataSet has a broader use as an
identifier for the purpose of improved workflow handling (IPTC Photo
Metadata: Job ID). These uses include:

* As an identifier for the picture (perhaps on some content management
system)
* As an identifier for a series of pictures, of which this one is part,
e.g. a group of pictures of the same event.

The first use should be mapped to the NewsML-G2 property <altId>, a
child of <contentMeta> which is available at PCL. <altId> has two
attributes: @type indicates the context of the identifier using a QCode,
and @environment indicates the business environment in which the
identifier can be used. This is expressed using one or more QCodes
(QCode List).

<altId type="idtype:systemRef" environment="acmesys:mdn__
acmesys:iim">SAD02</altId>

If the DataSet represents a Job ID, the recommended mapping is to the
NewsML-G2 <memberOf> property, a child of <itemMeta> (PCL only):

<memberOf type="myref:jobref">

[[_Ref237857576]] <name>SAD02</name>

</memberOf>

[[headline-1]]
Headline
^^^^^^^^

Maps to the <headline> child of <contentMeta>, a block type element:

<headline xml:lang="en-US">A firefighter walks past the remains of a
military

jet that crashed into homes in the University City neighborhood of San
Diego

</headline>

Note the use of @xml:lang to declare the language and variant "en-US".

[[copyright-notice]]
Copyright Notice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These fields correspond to the <copyrightNotice> element, a child of the
<rightsInfo> block.

<copyrightNotice>

Copyright 2008 Thomson Reuters

</copyrightNotice>

[[captionabstract]]
Caption/Abstract
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The contents of this field are placed in the <description> element, part
of <contentMeta> with a @role attribute to denote that the description
is a picture caption:

<description xml:lang="en-US" role="drol:caption">A firefighter
in a flameproof

suit walks past the remains of a military jet that crashed into homes in
the

University City neighborhood of San Diego, California December 8, 2008.
The

military F-18 jet crashed on Monday into the California neighborhood
near San

Diego after the pilot ejected, igniting at least one home, officials
said.

</description>

[[writereditor]]
Writer/Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The caption writer is often a different person to the photographer, so
aligns with the NewsML-G2 <contributor> property, a child of
<contentMeta>. If possible, use a QCode value to unambiguously identify
the contributing person and a @role to describe their role in the
workflow. This property may be extended (at PCL) to include contact
details and other information such as job title.

Reconciling NewsML-G2 with embedded metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Where equivalent properties exist in both NewsML-G2 metadata and
embedded (XMP or EXIF) metadata, the IPTC recommends that embedded
administrative metadata, such as <located>, MAY take precedence over
NewsML-G2 metadata, subject to guidance from the provider, and always
with caution.

For example, a picture may have GPS metadata embedded by the camera,
which may be different from the <located> property entered by a
journalist.

The difference may be one of precision: the GPS co-ordinates may be
precise, but hardly useful to the ultimate consumer. Even if a
human-readable value is derived from the GPS data, would this be better
than the information, if accurate, provided by the journalist? If the
difference is due to inaccuracy, the receiver would have no way of
knowing whether the journalist has made a mistake, or whether the camera
is incorrectly set.
