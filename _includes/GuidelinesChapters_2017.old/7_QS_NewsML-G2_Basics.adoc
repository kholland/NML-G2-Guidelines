About the Quick Start Guides
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This Quick Start Guide and its siblings in the next chapters are
intended to give implementers enough information about NewsML-G2 to
begin creating a useful working set of model NewsML-G2 documents for
their organisation, or to begin working with NewsML-G2 documents
provided by another organisation. This Basics Guide covers the NewsML-G2
features that are common to most types of content. Further Quick Start
Guides give more specific information about conveying types of content:
text, pictures, video, and news packages.

[[Basics]]
[[introduction-2]]
Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic structure of a NewsML-G2 Item document is common to all
applications. The available types of Item are:

* News Item: for all kinds of news content.
* Package Item: for structured collections of news content.
* Concept Item: for expressing knowledge about entities, abstract
concepts, and events.
* Knowledge Item: for collections of concepts, often grouped for a
specific purpose such as Controlled Vocabularies.
* Planning Item: for exchanging information about news coverage and
fulfilment.
* Catalog Item: for managing references to Controlled Vocabularies.

[[item-structure]]
Item structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The building blocks of a NewsML-G2 Item are shown in the diagram below:

image:BasicItemStructure2016.png[]
[[_Toc403107361]][[_Toc470002521]]

Figure 2: All NewsML-G2 Items share
this basic container structure

All have a root element that is specific to the type of Item that
contains identification, version and some basic information to initiate
the NewsML-G2 processor.

The Catalog information is required to resolve QCodes, a fundamental
feature of NewsML-G2 that enables partners to guarantee that codes used
within an Item are globally unique.

The Rights Information block allow publishers to assert fine-grained
information about copyright and usage terms as human-readable
statements, or by inclusion of a machine-readable rights expression
language such as RightsML.

The Item Metadata wrapper contains metadata about the Item as a whole,
and this is followed by metadata about whole of the content
<contentMeta>, and optionally by the <partMeta> wrapper, which enables
publishers to express metadata about specific parts of the content..

Optional "helper" structures are available for specialised processing
needs; their use is covered in Advanced Metadata Techniques.

Each type of NewsML-G2 Item has a specific wrapper element for content,
shown in the diagram below that also shows the basic top level elements
common to all NewsML-G2 Items. The colours of the wrapper elements in
the diagram are repeated in the code example in order to highlight the
relevant sections of the News Item:

The example in this Quick Guide to NewsML-G2 Basics uses a News Item
with text content to illustrate the basic principles in action. Read
this guide first, and proceed to further Quick Guides specific to Text,
Pictures, Video, and Packages, as needed.

[[root-element-newsitem]]
Root element <newsItem>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each NewsML-G2 Item Type uses a specific root element name as shown in
the diagram above. In the example News Item the root element is
<newsItem> (note camel case spelling).

[[root-element-attributes]]
Root element attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[item-identifier]]
Item Identifier
+++++++++++++++

All NewsML-G2 Items must have a @guid, an identifier that should be
globally unique for all time and independent of location. The IPTC has
registered a URN namespace for the purpose of creating GUIDs for
NewsML-G2 Items using a specification based on RFC3085. The syntax for a
@guid using this scheme is:

[source,xml]
guid="urn:newsml:[ProviderId]:[DateId]:[NewsItemId]"

Use an internet domain name owned by your organisation as a ProviderId,
for example:

[source,xml]
<newsItem guid= "urn:newsml:acmenews.com:20161018:US-FINANCE-FED"

Receivers of NewsML-G2 Items must resist any temptation to "reverse
engineer" the DateId part of a GUID to create a time-stamp. This may
have unintended consequences and result in errors. Use the appropriate
NewsML-G2 timestamp property instead.

[[version]]
Version
+++++++

A simple indicator of the version of the Item:

[source,xml]
version= "9"

Version numbers need not be consecutive, but must START at 1, and a new
version must be a higher number than the previous version. If version is
missing, the value is assumed to be 1. See Hidden Values of NewsML-G2,
below

[[standard]]
Standard
++++++++

A string denoting the IPTC Standard, in this case "NewsML-G2".

[source,xml]
standard="NewsML-G2"

[[standard-version]]
Standard Version
++++++++++++++++

A string denoting the major and minor version of the Standard being
used:

[source,xml]
 standardversion="2.23"

[[conformance]]
Conformance
+++++++++++

There are two levels of Conformance to the NewsML-G2 standard. The
"Core" conformance level (CCL) represents a minimal sub-set of NewsML-G2
that can usefully get work done, and is the default if @conformance is
omitted. In practice, many implementers use the properties of "Power"
conformance (PCL). If an implementer stays within the CCL, the
@conformance of the NewsML-G2 Item can be assumed and omitted, but must
be declared if using PCL:

[source,xml]
 conformance="power"

[[language]]
Language
++++++++

Setting the default language of XML elements with text content in
NewsML-G2 is UK English:

[source,xml]
 xml:lang="en-GB"

[[iptc-namespace]]
IPTC namespace
++++++++++++++

Sets the default namespace for elements:

[source,xml]
 xmlns="http://iptc.org/std/nar/2006-10-01/"

Putting this together, the required root element attributes are:

[source, xml]
<newsItem xmlns="http://iptc.org/std/nar/2006-10-01/"
	guid="urn:newsml:acmenews.com:20161018:US-FINANCE-FED"
	version="9"
	standard="NewsML-G2"
	standardversion="2.23"
	conformance="power"
	xml:lang="en-GB">

[[validating-code]]
Validating code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When developing a NewsML-G2 processing application, implementers will
need to validate the generated NewsML-G2 code against the appropriate
schema. To validate code at PCL against the latest version of the
NewsML-G2 specification (2.25) add the following code to the <newsItem>
element:

[source,xml]
<newsItem
 //...
 xmlns="http://iptc.org/std/nar/2006-10-01/"
 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
 xsi:schemaLocation="http://iptc.org/std/nar/2006-10-01/ __
http://www.iptc.org/std/NewsML-G2/2.23/specification/NewsML-G2_2.23-spec-All-Power.xsd"

To validate at CCL, substitute the name of the "Core" schema:

[source,xml]
_NewsML-G2_2.23-spec-All-Core.xsd_

The IPTC does NOT permit validation of production documents against XML
Schema files on the IPTC servers. The IPTC also recommends NOT
validating production documents as this will create dependencies on
external resources such as schema files and this could introduce points
of failure in the processing of NewsML-G2 Items.

[[catalog-wrapper-catalogref]]
Catalog wrapper <catalogRef>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Codes, short mnemonics used to express the value of properties such as
Category, are a long-established feature of news exchange. QCodes are
the NewsML-G2 mechanism that enables partners in news exchange to
guarantee that codes are globally unique. Without going into details of
the mechanism here, the News Item <catalog> enables a NewsML-G2
processor to resolve QCodes, and guarantee that uniqueness, by mapping
the code to a globally-unique URI. It is recommended that this URI
locates a web resource.

One of the few mandatory NewsML-G2 elements, <itemClass>, uses QCodes
issued by the IPTC to identify the business intention of the Item. For a
News Item, the scheme is News Item Nature, with a recommended Scheme
Alias of "ninat". Values from the scheme include (not limited to)
"ninat:text" and "ninat:picture". The catalog reference is:

[source,xml]
<catalog>
 <scheme alias="ninat" uri="http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/ninature/" />
</catalog>

Other types of NewsML-G2 Item use specific schemes for the <itemClass>
property.

All Scheme Aliases used in the example listing indicate IPTC NewsCodes +
vocabularies, except for the following +
alias values: _svc, cptype, geo,, prov._

As the CVs used by a provider are usually quite consistent across the
NewsML-G2 Items they publish, the IPTC recommends that the <catalog>
references are aggregated into a stand-alone file which is made
available as a web resource referenced by <catalogRef>. This is how the
IPTC publishes its Catalogs:

[source,xml]
<catalogRef
 href="http://www.iptc.org/std/catalog/catalog.IPTC-G2-Standards_29.xml"
/>

The use of stand-alone web resources is preferable because all of the
QCode mappings are shared across many NewsML-G2 Items; a local <catalog>
can only be used by the single Item.

It’s likely that provider-specific catalogs will be needed to resolve
QCodes used in the Item, for example:

[source,xml]
<catalogRef
 href="http://www.example.com/newsml-g2/catalog.enews_2.xml" />

Adding the Catalog information to the example results in the following:

[source,xml]
<newsItem xmlns="http://iptc.org/std/nar/2006-10-01/"
 guid="urn:newsml:acmenews.com:20161018:US-FINANCE-FED"
 version="9"
 standard="NewsML-G2"
 standardversion="2.23"
 conformance="power"
 xml:lang="en-GB">
 <catalogRef
  href="http://www.iptc.org/std/catalog/catalog.IPTC-G2-Standards_29.xml"
 />
 <catalogRef
  href="http://www.example.com/newsml-g2/catalog.enews_2.xml" 
 />

[[rights-information-wrapper-rightsinfo]]
Rights information wrapper <rightsInfo>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The optional <rightsInfo> wrapper holds copyright information and usage
terms, such as the following example:

[source,xml]
<rightsInfo>
 <copyrightHolder uri="http://www.example.com/about.html#copyright">
  <name>Example Enews LLP</name>
 </copyrightHolder>
 <copyrightNotice>Copyright 2016 Example Enews LLP, all rights reserved</copyrightNotice>
 <usageTerms>Not for use outside the United States</usageTerms>
</rightsInfo>

[[item-metadata-itemmeta]]
Item Metadata <itemMeta>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[mandatory-properties]]
Mandatory Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The mandatory <itemMeta> section has four mandatory elements, present in
the following order:

[[item-class]]
Item Class
++++++++++

As previously mentioned, the <itemClass> property describes the type of
content conveyed by the Item. It is mandatory to use one of the IPTC
News Item Nature NewsCodes (recommended Scheme Alias: "ninat") for the
Item Class of News Items and Package Items, expressed as a QCode:

[source,xml]
<itemClass qcode="ninat:text" />

Other possible values from this scheme include (not limited to)
"ninat:picture", "ninat:video" and "ninat:audio".

[[provider]]
Provider
++++++++

Can be represented by a QCode, or a URI. If the value of this property
is NOT taken from a controlled vocabulary, the @qcode or @uri will be
omitted and the child <name> element used to give a human-readable value
for the property. The IPTC recommends using a QCode with the Provider
NewsCodes, a controlled vocabulary of providers registered with the IPTC
with recommended Scheme Alias of "nprov":

[source,xml]
<provider qcode="nprov:REUTERS" />

[[version-created]]
Version Created
+++++++++++++++

This contains the date, time and time zone (or UTC) that _this version_
of the NewsML-G2 _Item_ was created. The value must be expressed as XML
Schema datetime: +
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss±hh:mm

[source,xml]
<versionCreated>2016-10-21T16:25:32-05:00</versionCreated>

The -05:00 denotes U.S. Eastern Standard Time offset from UTC

[[publication-status]]
Publication Status
++++++++++++++++++

Every NewsML-G2 Item must have a publication status. The value defaults
to "usable", which permits the <pubStatus> property to be omitted,
however it is recommended that a value is explicitly included:

[source,xml]
<pubStatus qcode="stat:usable" />

Publication status is highly likely to be used by most news agencies,
because the ability to explicitly signal the status of news is
essential. The use of the IPTC Publishing Status NewsCodes is mandatory.
Its recommended alias is "stat". Other values permitted by the scheme
are:

* stat:canceled (note U.S. spelling) means that the content of the
newsItem must not be used, ever.
* stat:withheld means the content must not be used until further notice.

When an Item is cancelled, it must never be used, but an Item that has
been withheld may subsequently have its status updated to "usable". For
further information on processing rules, see Publishing Status.

[[use-of-uris-in-place-of-qcodes]]
Use of URIs in place of QCodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The original NewsML-G2 developers wanted to use URIs as the preferred
way to identify concepts, as this would enable the resulting concept
identifiers to be globally unique and optionally to be a reference to a
web resource. The constraints on network bandwidth (compared to today)
led the developers to propose QCodes to represent URIs, because:

* they are lightweight and economise file sizes,
* although they are designed to reference web resources, the delivery of
data in response to requesting QCodes that are resolved to full URIs is
optional; the codes may be used "as is" without de-referencing to the
full URI.

Later, some providers asked for flexibility to use full URIs in property
values, so from NewsML-G2 v2.11 this feature was added enabling @uri to
be used in place of, or in parallel with, @qcode. (where both are used,
@qcode takes precedence). The <pubStatus> assertion:

[source,xml]
<pubStatus qcode="stat:usable" />

could be expressed using a URI as:

[source,xml]
<pubStatus uri="http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/pubstatusg2/usable" />

Further, in NewsML-G2 v2.18 onwards, other properties with QCode Type
values had "URI siblings" added, for example properties with @role may
now have a value expressed as @roleuri. In NewsML-G2 v2.20, properties
with a mandatory @qcode were changed so that @uri may be used instead.
For details of these changes, see Full list of the QCode type attributes
and their URI siblings.

[[optional-properties]]
Optional Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following optional properties are frequently used by NewsML-G2
providers.

[[first-created]]
First Created
+++++++++++++

The <firstCreated> element indicates when the first version of the Item
(not the content) was created.

[source,xml]
<firstCreated>2016-10-18T13:12:21-05:00</firstCreated>

[[embargoed]]
Embargoed
++++++++++

Business-to-business news organisations often use an _embargo_ to
release information in advance, on the strict understanding that it may
not be released into the public domain until after the _embargo time_
has expired, or until some other form of permission has been given.

Embargoed is NOT the same as the Publishing Status; embargoed content
should have a publishing status of "usable".

[source,xml]
<embargoed>2016-10-23T12:00:00Z</embargoed>

It is not required to give any further information about the embargo
conditions, but some providers may provide a natural language <edNote>,
see below.

[[service]]
Service
+++++++

The <service> element allows the provider to declare which of its
services delivered this package, using a Controlled Vocabulary:

[source,xml]
<service qcode="svc:uknews">
 <name>UK News Service</name>
</service>

[[editorial-note]]
Editorial Note
++++++++++++++

The <edNote> element contains a note that is intended to be read by
internal staff at the receiving organisation, but not published to the
end-user; in this example it conveys some optional information about the
release condition imposed by the <embargoed> element:

[source,xml]
<edNote>
 Note to editors: STRICTLY EMBARGOED. Not for public release until 12noon
 on Sunday, October 23, 2016.
</edNote>

[[signal]]
Signal
++++++

Additional processing instructions can be given using <signal> and its
@qcode. This example uses the IPTC Signal NewsCodes (recommended Scheme
Alias "sig") that advises the end-user that this Item updates a previous
versions of the Item:

[source,xml]
<signal qcode="sig:update" />

The other value in the Signal scheme is "correction". There is further
information on giving fine-grained information about signalling the
reason and impact of updates in the Processing Updates and Corrections.
For guidance on applying signals to different parts of an Item’s
content, see Special processing instructions for metadata about a part
of the content.

[[link]]
Link
++++

The <link> element has two basic purposes:

* To assert relationships to other Items, such as a previous version of
an Item
* To create a navigable link from an Item to some supporting or
additional resource.

This example provides a "see also" link to a resource on the Web that
end-users can view to get further information about the event. @rel is
used to denote the reason that the link is provided. In this example,
the QCode uses the recommended IPTC Item Relation NewsCodes with a
recommended Scheme Alias of "irel" and the code value is "seeAlso":

[source,xml]
<link rel="irel:seeAlso" href="http://www.example.com/video/20081222-PNN-1517-407624/index.html"/>

[[completed-item-metadata]]
Completed Item Metadata
+++++++++++++++++++++++

[source,xml]
<itemMeta>
 <itemClass qcode="ninat:text" />
 <provider qcode="nprov:REUTERS" />
 <versionCreated>2016-10-21T16:25:32-05:00</versionCreated>
 <firstCreated>2016-10-18T13:12:21-05:00</firstCreated>
 <embargoed>2016-10-23T12:00:00Z</embargoed>
 <pubStatus qcode="stat:usable" />
 <service qcode="svc:uknews">
  <name>UK News Service</name>
 </service>
 <edNote>
  Note to editors: STRICTLY EMBARGOED. Not for public release until 12noon
  on Sunday, October 23, 2016.
 </edNote>
 <signal qcode="sig:update" />
 <link rel="irel:seeAlso" href="http://www.example.com/video/20081222-PNN-1517-407624/index.html"/>
</itemMeta>

[[content-metadata-contentmeta]]
Content Metadata <contentMeta>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conceptually, there are two kinds of content metadata: Administrative
and Descriptive.

[[administrative-metadata]]
Administrative Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is information about the content that cannot necessarily be deduced
by examining it, for example: when it was created and/or modified.
Administrative properties that are widely used by implementers of
NewsML-G2 for editorial content are:

* Timestamps (Created, Modified)
* Story location (Located)
* Creator
* Information Source

[[timestamps]]
Timestamps
++++++++++

The <contentCreated> timestamp corresponds to a "Created on" field of
the story. It is expressed in NewsML-G2 as Truncated DateTime data type,
meaning that the date-time elements may optionally be stripped, starting
from the right. If required, the <contentModified> property may also be
used to contain the "Last Edit" timestamp. This must be later than the
Created timestamp.

[source,xml]
<contentCreated>2016-10-21T15:21:06-05:00</contentCreated>
<contentModified>2016-10-21T16:22:45-05:00</contentModified>

[[located]]
Located
+++++++

The place that the content was created uses the <located> element. Note
that this is not necessarily the place of the event or subject. For
example, for a UK story written in the London office, <located> would be
"London"; a picture of Mount Fuji taken from downtown Tokyo would have a
<located> value of "Tokyo".

The semantics of <located> are similar to the natural-language location
carried in the dateline that often prefaces news (such as "BERLIN,
October 24") but can be conveyed more precisely, and in terms that may
be more readily processed by software, using a @qcode or @uri:

[source,xml]
<located type="cptype:city" qcode="geo:345678">
 <name>Berlin</name>
</located>

The optional @type uses a controlled vocabulary to indicate the nature
of the location being expressed; in the example this indicates that
<located> refers to a city.

[[broader-narrower]]
Broader, Narrower
+++++++++++++++++

Both Located and Subject (below) contain child elements that express a
specific relationship between entities or concepts. For example, the
content originated in the city of Berlin and the <located> element shows
that the city of Berlin has a "broader" relationship – that is a
child-to-parent relationship – to Berlin the state, and to Germany the
country:

[source,xml]
	<located type="cptype:city" qcode="geo:345678">
		<name>Berlin</name>
			<broader type="cptype:statprov" qcode="prov:2365">
				<name>Berlin</name>
			</broader>
			<broader type="cptype:country" qcode="iso3166-1a2:DE">
				<name>Germany</name>
			</broader>
	</located>

[[creator]]
Creator
+++++++

The writer, photographer or other author of content is expressed using
the <creator> element:

[source,xml]
<creator uri="http://www.example.com/staff/mjameson">
 <name>Meredith Jameson</name>
</creator>

[[information-source]]
Information Source
++++++++++++++++++

The <infoSource> element, together with its optional @role, enables
finely-grained identification of the various parties who provided
information used to create and develop an item of news. If absent, the
default value of @role is the originator of the information used to
create or enhance the content. For a detailed view on using <infoSource>
see Identifying Sources and Workflow Actors.

[source,xml]
<infoSource uri="http://www.example.com/pressreleases/201610/newproducts.html"/>

[[descriptive-metadata]]
Descriptive Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These properties set the context of news content in relation to other
news by describing and classifying it. Information that has historically
been carried within the content itself, such as the headline and by-line
(for text) or embedded metadata (for pictures) may also be specified as
metadata. The practical benefit is that the end user no longer needs to
scan or retrieve the actual content in order to process it. None of the
Descriptive Metadata elements are mandatory, but the following feature
frequently in NewsML-G2 implementations.

[[subject]]
Subject
+++++++

The subject matter of content uses the <subject> element. When the value
of the Subject is taken from a Controlled Vocabulary, this is identified
using either a @qcode or @uri:

[source,xml]
<subject type="cpnat:abstract" qcode="medtop:20000523" />
<subject uri= _"http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/mediatopic/20000523"_ />

For concepts not taken from a CV, the identifier is omitted and the name
of the concept is given in the child <name> element, for example:

[source,xml]
<subject>
 <name>Labour Market</name>
</subject>

The optional @type uses the IPTC "nature of the concept" NewsCodes
(recommended scheme alias "cpnat") to indicate the type of concept being
expressed, for example, an abstract concept, that is a concept that does
not represent a real-world entity, but something like an idea, or news
category.

[source,xml]
<subject type="cpnat:abstract" qcode="medtop:04000000">
 <name xml:lang="en-GB">economy, business and finance</name>
</subject>

The above example uses a concept from the IPTC Media Topic NewsCodes.
Also note the use of the W3C XML attribute xml:lang that expresses the
language used for the element’s value. It is also possible to add
relationships to related concepts, as shown above in <located>. For
example:

[source,xml]
<subject type="cpnat:abstract" qcode="medtop:04000000">
 <name xml:lang="en-GB">economy, business and finance</name>
</subject>
<subject type="cpnat:abstract" qcode="medtop:20000523">
 <name xml:lang="en-GB">labour market</name>
 <name xml:lang="de">Arbeitsmarkt</name>
 <broader qcode="medtop:04000000" /> relationship property
</subject>

The IPTC highly recommends that providers use the Media Topic NewsCodes
unless there is an over-riding requirement to use proprietary codes.
This promotes inter-operability and standardisation in news exchange. It
is also recommended that if a <name> is used in conjunction with a
QCode, then the value of the <name> agrees with the value in the Scheme
for the language specified in xml:lang. IPTC NewsCodes are provided in
UK English (en-GB) and translations in French and German have been
provided by IPTC members.

The "medtop" code prefix is the recommended Scheme Alias for the Codes,
which is resolved via the IPTC Catalog (see <catalogRef>, above) to the
Scheme URI http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/mediatopic/ This is guaranteed
to be globally unique because it is part of the Internet Domain
controlled by the IPTC. Appending the code "04000000" to the Scheme URI
forms the Concept URI _http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/mediatopic/04000000_
that cannot be confused with a concept with the same code _04000000_
from another source.

When using @type to indicate the nature of the concept, the possible
values from the IPTC Concept Nature NewsCodes are:

* Abstract: a concept that does not represent a real-world entity
* Event
* geoArea: a geo-political area
* Object: A real-world object, such as a painting; an aircraft
* Organisation
* Person
* Point of Interest

[[genre]]
Genre
+++++

The <genre> element indicates the style of the content, in this example
"interview" as a property that is distinct from <subject> that is used
to indicate the subject matter of content. In the example, an IPTC Genre
NewsCodes value of "Interview" is used:

[source,xml]
<genre qcode="genre:interview">
 <name xml:lang="en-GB">Interview</name>
</genre>

[[slugline]]
Slugline
++++++++

Some news services implemented in NewsML-G2 retain the <slugline>
property as a human-readable index for legacy reasons; therefore
receivers may sometimes see this property. However, it has never been a
completely reliable identifier, and it is recommended that more
purposeful identifiers that are also machine-readable are implemented in
its place.

[source,xml]
<slugline>US-Finance-Fed</slugline>

[[headline]]
Headline
++++++++

Even if the Headline is carried inline in text content, it is useful
also to place it explicitly in metadata so that it can more easily be
identified and extracted by the end-user:

<headline> Fed to halt QE to avert "bubble"</headline>

[[completed-content-metadata]]
Completed Content Metadata
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Content <contentSet>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The content of a NewsML-G2 document varies according to its Item type:
the example below shows a News Item with a <contentSet> wrapper
containing a trivial text payload. Following this code example are
skeletal examples showing the other options for conveying content in
NewsML-G2 News Items and Package Items:

[[news-content-options-for-news-items-and-package-items]]
News Content options for News Items and Package Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The News Item <contentSet> contains a single logical piece of content,
but allows alternative renditions of the SAME content to be carried in a
single NewsML-G2 Item:

[source,xml]
<contentSet>
 <inlineXML contenttype="application/nitf+xml"><!-- A VALID MEDIA TYPE -->
  <!-- Inline XML must contain well-formed XML such as NITF or XHTML -->
 </inlineXML>
</contentSet>

or

[source,xml]
<contentSet>
 <inlineData>
  <!-- Inline Data contains plain text -->
 </inlineData>
</contentSet>

or

[source,xml]
<contentSet>
 <!-- Remote Content contains a reference to a binary asset such as -->
 <!—-a PDF or image file -->
 <remoteContent rendition="rnd:one" />
 <remoteContent rendition="rnd:two" />
 <remoteContent rendition="rnd:three" />
</contentSet>

Package Item content is wrapped by the <groupSet> element, which can
contain one or more <group> children. Each Group contains references to
Items that make up the News Package, using the <itemRef> element. A
Group can also reference other Groups via the <groupRef> element.

[source,xml]
<groupSet ... >
 <group ...>
  <itemRef ... >
   <!-- Properties extracted from the packaged Item -->
  </itemRef>
  <groupRef />
  </group>
 <group ... >
  //...
 </group>
</groupSet>

Summary and Next Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section has covered the basic structure that is common to all
NewsML-G2 Items, and also outlined properties that are commonly used for
news content. Further Quick Start Guides show how to build upon this
foundation:

*Quick Start – Text* takes an example news story and shows how the
information on an editor’s screen would be implemented in NewsML-G2.

*Quick Start – Pictures* takes an example image and its embedded
metadata and converts this to a NewsML-G2 properties with several image
renditions carried in a single NewsML-G2 Item. The guide also shows how
to express the various technical characteristics of images using
NewsML-G2 properties.

*Quick Start – Video* is split into two sections: the first covers a
simple case of a standalone video file with various technical renditions
expressed in NewsML-G2; the second uses a more comprehensive structure
that separates the metadata for multiple segments of a video, using the
<partMeta> wrapper.

*Quick Start – Packages* shows how NewsML-G2 Items and other kinds of
content can be assembled into Packages of managed objects with an
explicit structure.

[[hidden-values-of-newsml-g2]]
Hidden Values of NewsML-G2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are some default values set by the specification which allow an
element or attribute to be omitted and the default assumed. The list
below shows NewsML-G2 elements and attributes which optionally appear in
an Item but for which a usable value or status exists.

[[all-newsml-g2-items]]
All NewsML-G2 items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* @version of the root element = "1"
* @conformance of the root element = "core"
* <embargoed> = no embargo
* <pubStatus> = "usable"
* <catalog> and <catalogRef> = one is required; many of either, or a mix
of both may be used
* @scope of <hash> = "content". Hash value is a message digest included
in the Item for security purposes. A hash scope of "content" indicates
that the hash value was derived by hashing some/all of the content only.
* @why (attribute of many elements) = "direct". The attribute value
indicates that the value is directly related to the content.
* @how (attribute of many elements) = "person". The attribute indicates
how the value was extracted from the content: by a person. (See Why and
How metadata has been added: @why and @how for essential guidance on the
use of @why and @how.)
* @custom (attribute of many elements) = "false". The attribute
indicates that the property was added specifically for a customer or
group of customers
* @dir (many elements) = "ltr". The directionality of the script of the
language of the property is left to right.

[[news-items-only]]
News Items only
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* @timeunit (when @duration is used) = "seconds"
* @dimensionunit (when @width/@height is used) = (for example) pixels
for a still picture. See the Quick Start Guide – Pictures for details.
* @encoding of <inlineData> = "base64". This is the default binary
encoding for Inline Data.

[[package-item-only]]
Package Item only
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* @mode of the <group> = "bag" – an unordered collection of
complementary components
